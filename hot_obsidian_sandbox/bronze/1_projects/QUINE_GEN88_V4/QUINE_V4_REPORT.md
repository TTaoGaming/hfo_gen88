# HFO GEN 88 BATON QUINE (V4_RECOVERY)

> **"Restore the Original: All spelling out the words Obsidian is very specific."**


## 🚨 FORENSIC ANALYSIS: PREVIOUS VERSION FAILURES

### V1: Social Metaphor Contamination
- **Identity Theater**: Relied on "Legendary Commanders" (Lidless Legion, etc.) instead of the pure protocol.
- **Terminology Slop**: Included "Hive" and "Prey" concepts which were not properly abstracted.
- **Lattice Hallucination**: The 8x8 grid was loosely defined and inconsistent.

### V2: Artifact Drift
- **Documentation Only**: Failed to provide a functional quine script.
- **Context Loss**: Still contained references to "Sir Commanders" and social structures.

### V3: Implementation Hallucination
- **Naming Inconsistency**: Failed to follow the "Obsidian X Obsidian verb X Domain" pattern.
- **False Success Claims**: The agent claimed alignment while drifting into "Infrastructure Theater" (fake NATS/Temporal mocks).
- **Galois Dissociation**: The "Galloway Slatus" was misinterpreted, leading to a breakdown in the semantic cross-product.
