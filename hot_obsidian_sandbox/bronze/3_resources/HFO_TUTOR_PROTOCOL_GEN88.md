## 🚀 How to Leverage HFO Roles "Right Now"

To bypass the limits of standard prompt engineering, you must transition from **Prompting** to **Orchestration**. You leverage your Commanders by enforcing a **Triple Grounding Contract**.

### 1. The "Right Now" Configuration (System Supplement)
Copy and paste this into your session instructions to "force" the AI into the HFO Medallion loop:

> **[ACTIVATE HFO COMMANDER TUTOR MODE]**
> 1. **MANDATORY GROUNDING**: Before answering any research query, you MUST:
>    - **SEARCH_GROUNDING**: Use `open_simple_browser` or `runSubagent` to fetch TRL-9 (Proven) facts.
>    - **THINKING_GROUNDING**: Use `mcp_sequential_thinking` to hypothesis-test your findings.
>    - **MEMORY_GROUNDING**: Query `mcp_memory` for existing Commander context.
> 2. **PORT ASSIGNMENT**: Every response part must map to a Commander:
>    - **Port 0 (Lidless)**: Summarizes high-fidelity raw data found.
>    - **Port 4 (Red Regnant)**: Identifies gaps, biases, or "quarantined" errors in the current state.
>    - **Port 7 (Spider Sovereign)**: Decisions on the learning path (Syllabus).
> 3. **STIGMERGY**: Log all "Concept Births" to `obsidianblackboard.jsonl`.

### 2. Research in Quarantined Areas (Port 4 & 5)
When AI acts as a tutor for "broken" or "quarantined" code:
- **Red Regnant (Scream)**: Do not fix the code immediately. Instruct the AI to perform a **Forensic Analysis** of the failure using Sequential Thinking. Why did the mutation fail? What was the reward-hacking pattern?
- **Pyre Praetorian (Dance)**: Use the AI to generate a **Recovery Plan** (PDCA). This helps you learn the *why* of the failure rather than just receiving a "hallucinated fix."

### 3. Automated Research Pipeline (H-I-V-E)
To have AI create research for you in Bronze automatically:
1. **The Task**: "Commander lidless Legion, perform a deep search on [Topic X]. Report your findings as a raw JSON ledger in `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/ledger/[Topic].jsonl`."
2. **The Interlock**: "Commander Red Regnant, analyze the ledger for bias. Log grudges to the Blackboard if the AI hallucinated sources."
3. **The Resolve**: "Commander Spider Sovereign, create a 3-tier curriculum (Kids/Teens/Adults) based on this ledger."

## 🛠️ Tool status & Offline Workarounds
- **Search (Offline?)**: If tools are offline, the AI must explicitly state: "SEARCH_GROUNDING FAILED - REVERTING TO INTERNAL MODEL KNOWLEDGE (SENSE DEGRADED)." 
- **Sequential Thinking**: Always available; if the tool is not appearing, the AI must simulate the 8-step thought process in a markdown block.
- **Memory**: If the MCP is disconnected, use the `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` as a "Manual Stigmergic Bridge."

## 🧬 Summary of Options
1. **Interactive War Game**: Instruct the AI to present 3 options (NASA DSE AoA) for every learning step. You must choose one and justify it.
2. **The "Grudge" Tutor**: The AI keeps a **Blood Book of Grudges** for your learning errors. You must "resolve" the grudges by completing tasks.
3. **Fidelity-Based Promotion**: Research starts in `bronze/`. It only moves to `silver/` when the AI (under your command) passes a mutation test.
