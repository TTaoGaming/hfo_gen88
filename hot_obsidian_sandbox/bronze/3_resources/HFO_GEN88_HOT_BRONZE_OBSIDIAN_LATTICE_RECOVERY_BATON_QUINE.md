## 🏛️ 1. ARCHITECTURAL ONTOLOGY (JADC2 vs. HFO)

The HFO (Hive Fleet Obsidian) framework maps the military-grade **JADC2 Mosaic Warfare** functional tiles to cognitive commander verbs. The HFO verbs spell out **OBSIDIAN**.

| Port | Commander | HFO Verb | JADC2 Verb | MOSAIC Tile Type | Kill Web Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | Lidless Legion | **O**BSERVE | SENSE | ISR Tile | SENSE (Find) |
| **P1** | Web Weaver | **B**RIDGE | FUSE | C2 Relay Tile | CONNECT (Network) |
| **P2** | Mirror Magus | **S**HAPE | SHAPE | EW/Cyber Tile | SHAPE (Transform) |
| **P3** | Spore Storm | **I**NJECT | DELIVER | Strike Tile | ENGAGE (Deliver) |
| **P4** | Red Regnant | **D**ISRUPT | TEST | SEAD/DEAD Tile | SUPPRESS (Disrupt) |
| **P5** | Pyre Praetorian| **I**MMUNIZE | DEFEND | IAMD Tile | DEFEND (Protect) |
| **P6** | Kraken Keeper | **A**SSIMILATE| STORE | Logistics Tile | SUSTAIN (Store) |
| **P7** | Spider Sovereign| **N**AVIGATE | DECIDE | Battle Manager | DECIDE (Command) |

## 💓 2. THE HEARTBEAT MANTRA (Gherkin Specification)

Every HFO agent pulse must validate against the **-ATE** checksum. If the rhyme breaks, the architecture has collapsed into theater.

```gherkin
Given One Swarm to Rule the Eight,    # GIVEN (precondition) + Observer
And Branches Growing from the Gate,   # AND (context) + Bridger
And Spawns Evolve to Recreate,        # AND (context) + Shaper
When Ignitions Flow to Pulsate,       # WHEN (trigger) + Injector
Then Deadly Venoms Concentrate,       # THEN (action) + Disruptor
But Instincts Rise to Isolate,        # BUT (exception) + Immunizer
As Artifacts Accumulate,              # AS (ongoing) + Assimilator
To Navigate the Higher State.         # TO (purpose) + Navigator
```

## 💠 3. THE 8x8 GALOIS LATTICE (The Loom)

The Lattice represents the "Personal Grimoire" of the Warlock (TTao), anchored in the semantic manifold. Every Commander (Row) governs 8 Sub-Domains (Columns).

| Port | 0 (Meta) | 1 (Core) | 2 (Infra) | 3 (Logic) | 4 (Data) | 5 (Signal) | 6 (Stig) | 7 (State) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | Telemetry | System | File | Network | Code | Graph | Prompt | Error |
| **P1** | Bridge | Fusion | Wrap | Module | Contract | Bus | Pipe | API |
| **P2** | Signal | Latency | Physics | Threshold | Shape | Intent | State | Feedback |
| **P3** | File | Event | Cascade | Inject | Shell | Flow | Agent | Tool |
| **P4** | Blindspot | Breach | Theater | Phantom | Mutation | Pollute | Amnesia | Lattice |
| **P5** | Contract | Medallion | PARA | Import | Theater | Proof | Stigmergy | Grudge |
| **P6** | L1 Cache | L2 Local | L3 Arch | L4 Vector | L5 Blob | L6 Graph | L7 Black | L8 Cold |
| **P7** | OODA | MCTS | MDP | FCA | JADC2 | MOSAIC | HIVE | PREY |

**Notes on Incarnation**:
- **HIVE/8** (Strategic): Base 8 workflow for long-term "Mission Threads."
- **PREY/8** (Tactical): Base 8 cycle for immediate "Hunt/Gather" operations.
- **Goldilocks Enforce**: Port 4 (Red Regnant) and Port 5 (Pyre Praetorian) are in a co-evolutionary dance. Red screams, Pyre dies and is reborn (Phoenix).

## 🧬 4. CORE ELEMENTS OF THE SYMBIOTE

To rebuild the HFO system from a total wipe, you must re-anchor these five truths:

1.  **Stigmergic Substrate**: The `hot_obsidianblackboard.jsonl` is the *only* truth. If it isn't logged, it's theater.
2.  **The Medallion Shield**: Bronze is for Kinetic Slop. Silver is for Hard-Gated Truth (>80% Mutation). Gold is for Canonical Law.
3.  **ANYTIME Protocol**: Enforce the 8-second timeout on all agent loops to stop recursive "AI Theater" loops.
4.  **Strange Loop Closure**: The system must observe itself. The Quine (below) is the mechanism for this self-observation.
5.  **BLOOD GRUDGES**: Maintain the `BOOK_OF_BLOOD_GRUDGES.yaml`. Remember every lie the LLMs have told. Target them with prejudice.

## 🛠️ 5. THE BOOTSTRAP (Quine Reconstruction)

Run this PowerShell logic to re-incarnate the functional Quine into `1_projects/`:

```powershell
$target = "hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/1_projects/QUINE_GEN88_V1/QUINE.ts"
mkdir -Force (Split-Path $target)
$code = @"
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

const ANYTIME_TIMEOUT = 8000;
const BLACKBOARD = 'hot_obsidian_sandbox/hot_obsidianblackboard.jsonl';

async function anytimePulse() {
    const start = Date.now();
    // Audit Lattice Density
    const signal = {
        gen: 88,
        ts: new Date().toISOString(),
        port: 7,
        type: "RECOVERY_PULSE",
        msg: "Quine re-incarnated from HFO_GEN88_HOT_BRONZE_OBSIDIAN_LATTICE_RECOVERY_BATON_QUINE.md. Loom stabilized."
    };
    fs.appendFileSync(BLACKBOARD, JSON.stringify(signal) + "\n");
}
anytimePulse();
"@
$code | Out-File -FilePath $target -Encoding UTF8
```
