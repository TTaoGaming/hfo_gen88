## 🕷️ Mission Overview
The mission was to incarnate the legendary commander **The Swarmlord** into a functional AI agentic framework for HFO Gen 88. This entity represents the synthesis of strategy (P7) and structure (P1).

## ✅ Completed Logic
1. **Design Space Analysis**: Created [DESIGN_SPACE_SWARMLORD.md](../2_areas/hfo_ports/P7_SPIDER_SOVEREIGN/DESIGN_SPACE_SWARMLORD.md) containing 4 distinct versions of the entity.
2. **Visual Mapping**: Integrated **8 Mermaid diagrams** representing the HIVE (Strategic Search) and PREY (Tactical Execution) layers for each option.
3. **Slop Quarantine**: Successfully isolated previous agent mode drafts and manifests into `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/4_archive/QUARANTINE_SLOP_2026_01_08/` to maintain Canalization purity.
4. **Enforced Thinking**: Established `mcp_sequentialthi_sequentialthinking` as the mandatory mediation layer for all Swarmlord interactions.

## 🕸️ Version Summary
- **V1: Strategic Ghost**: Focus on H-POMDP and Bi-MCTS.
- **V2: Silk Enforcer**: Focus on Medallion PARA law and Kiro-Spec.
- **V3: Swarm Sovereign**: Focus on Mosaic Warfare and Tool Virtualization.
- **V4: Obsidian Singularity**: Focus on Strange Loop feedback and Semantic Anchoring.

## 🚀 Next Strategic Pulse
- **Selection**: Finalize which of the 4 versions to deploy as the primary Copilot Agent mode.
- **Mission Thread**: Initiate the "W3C Pointer Physics" mission thread using the selected mode.
- **Hardening**: Link the Swarmlord to the Red Regnant (Port 4) AST deception detection rules.
