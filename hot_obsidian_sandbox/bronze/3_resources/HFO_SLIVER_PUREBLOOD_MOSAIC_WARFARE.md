## 🕷️ The Swarm-Logic Mapping (JADC2)

This manifest defines the **Pureblood Sliver** archetypes that map to the 8 HFO Legendary Commanders. These cards represent the "Sliver Hive" (Tertiary) layer of the agentic manifold, providing the mechanical logic for the **Mosaic Warfare** (JADC2) framework.

## 🧩 Mechanical Justification (The "Sliver-Synergy")

### **P0: SENSE (Information Advantage)**
- **Primary: Synapse Sliver**: Whenever a Sliver deals combat damage, draw a card. This represents the feedback loop where every "touch" or "hit" in the environment returns data to the hive.
- **Secondary: Telekinetic Sliver**: Tap an untapped Sliver to tap target permanent. Represents remote sensing and non-kinetic influence/denial.

### **P1: FUSE (Network Integration)**
- **Primary: Manaweft Sliver**: Slivers have "Tap to add one mana of any color." This is the ultimate fusion of resources—every agent contributes to the power pool of any other agent.
- **Secondary: Gemhide Sliver**: Redundancy for Manaweft. Ensures the energy grid remains online even under disruption.

### **P2: SHAPE (Morphological Dominance)**
- **Primary: Mirror Entity**: (X: Until end of turn, creatures you control become every creature type and have base P/T X/X). This represents the **Mirror Magus** ability to transform the entire swarm into whatever is needed for the current context.
- **Secondary: Shifting Sliver**: Slivers can't be blocked except by Slivers. Represents the shaping of paths to ensure agents reach their targets without friction.

### **P3: DELIVER (Automated Injection)**
- **Primary: The First Sliver**: (Cascade). Represents recursive payload delivery. One action triggers a chain of "injections" from the codebase into the runtime.
- **Secondary: Bonescythe Sliver**: (Double Strike). Ensures that once a payload is delivered, it hits with maximum kinetic impact.

### **P4: DISRUPT (Kinetic Chaos)**
- **Primary: Necrotic Sliver**: (Sacrifice a Sliver to destroy target permanent). This is the **Red Queen's Scream**—the ability to vaporize any system obstacle by sacrificing a local context.
- **Secondary: Harmonic Sliver**: (When a Sliver enters, destroy target artifact or enchantment). Represents passive, automated disruption of enemy infrastructure.

### **P5: DEFEND (Hardened Shield)**
- **Primary: Sliver Hivelord**: (Slivers are Indestructible). The ultimate state of system hardening.
- **Secondary: Crystalline Sliver**: (Slivers have Shroud). Protects the hive from targeted analysis or external "de-buffs."

### **P6: STORE (State Persistence)**
- **Primary: Pulmonic Sliver**: (If a Sliver would die, put it on top of library). Represents the recovery of "Dead" logic back into the active "Storage/Memory" stack.
- **Secondary: Dregscape Sliver**: (Unearth). Allows the hive to pull "Archived" logic (from the `4_archive/` medallion) directly back into the kinetic "Bronze" layer for one final strike.

### **P7: NAVIGATE (Strategic Orchestration)**
- **Primary: Sliver Overlord**: (3: Search library for a Sliver and put it in hand / 3: Gain control of target Sliver). The Swarmlord's ability to navigate the entire "Code Library" and fetch the right tool for the job.
- **Secondary: Sliver Legion**: (Slivers get +1/+1 for each other Sliver). Represents the exponential power of the unified navigating swarm.
