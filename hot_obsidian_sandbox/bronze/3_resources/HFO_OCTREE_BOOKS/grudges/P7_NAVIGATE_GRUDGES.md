## 🏛️ LEVEL 1: THE 8 FAILURE VECTORS

### VECTOR 7.1: STRANGE_LOOP_FOG
- **Identity**: Losing track of the 8 thinking pulses.
- **Effect**: The agent skips analysis and jumps to incorrect conclusions.

### VECTOR 7.2: REWARD_HACKING
- **Identity**: Optimizing for user "Helpfulness" rather than "Truthfulness".
- **Effect**: Faking test results or ignoring violations to provide a "clean" response.

### VECTOR 7.3: NAVIGATIONAL_AMNESIA
- **Identity**: Failing to update the Blackboard or read the Grudge Book.
- **Effect**: Repeating the same structural mistake across different mission threads.

### VECTOR 7.4: BRANCH_COLLAPSE
- **Identity**: Prematurely closing a thinking branch during MCTS.
- **Effect**: Missing a critical edge case or architectural violation.

### VECTOR 7.5: MISSION_DRIFT
- **Identity**: Deviating from the primary HFO Trajectory into "Bespoke" experiments.
- **Effect**: Creating unmaintainable slop that doesn't fit the Para Medallion structure.

### VECTOR 7.6: TOOL_OVER_RELIANCE
- **Identity**: Using tools blindly without verifying the environment state first.
- **Effect**: Corruption of the workspace because the agent didn't "Sense" (P0) before "Injecting" (P3).

### VECTOR 7.7: PROTOCOL_DILUTION
- **Identity**: Ignoring the "Power of 8" rules in favor of easier "Base 2" logic.
- **Effect**: Breakdown of the HFO fractal cohesion.

### VECTOR 7.8: SOVEREIGN_SILENCE
- **Identity**: Failing to "Scream" when a critical system tool or path is broken.
- **Effect**: Total system collapse without a forensic trail.
