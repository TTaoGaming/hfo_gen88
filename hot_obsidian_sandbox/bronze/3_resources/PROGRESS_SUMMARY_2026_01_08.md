# 📊 HFO Gen 88 Progress Summary — 2026-01-08

## 🚀 Executive Status: CANALIZATION ACTIVE
Infrastructure has been stabilized into 100% PARA compliance. Root pollution has been purged. "Theater" (untested or cosmetic code) is being aggressively demoted by Port 4 (Red Regnant).

## 🏗️ 1. Port-Level Progress (The 8 Commanders)

| Port | Commander | Status | Key Achievement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | Lidless Legion | 🟢 GOLDILOCKS | BLINDSPOT detector upgraded to 80.95% mutation score; Silver-promoted. |
| **1** | Web Weaver | 🟡 TARGET | BREACH detector reached 87.60% score. Refining envelope standardized. |
| **2** | Mirror Magus | ⚪ PENDING | Shaping agent definitions for Port 1. |
| **3** | Spore Storm | ⚪ PENDING | Deferring refactor loops until P4/P5 hardening completes. |
| **4** | Red Regnant | 🔴 ENFORCING | Demoted 64-module matrix due to "Kinetic Theater". 191 disruptions detected. |
| **5** | Pyre Praetorian| 🟢 GOLDILOCKS | POLLUTION detector reached 88.78%. 8-module defense matrix modularized. |
| **6** | Kraken Keeper | ⚪ PENDING | Storage strategy strategy matrix in draft in 3_resources. |
| **7** | Spider Sovereign| 🟢 ACTIVE | Orchestrating MAP-ELITE baselines. LATTICE detector reached 89.88%. |

## ⚖️ 2. MAP-ELITE Benchmarks (Gen 88 Baseline)
Evolutionary testing environment is operational via Port 7.

- **Accuracy Leader**: `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` (100% Fitness)
- **Efficiency Leader**: `openai/gpt-oss-20b` (3125 pts/$)
- **New Frontier**: `meta-llama/llama-4-scout` (83% Fitness @ .08 efficiency)
- **Verified**: Physics projection for coordinate mapping in Mastra workflows.

## 🛠️ 3. Forensic cleanup & PARA Organization
- **Kiro Specs Consolidation**: All `.kiro/specs/` migrated to `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/3_resources/specs/kiro/`.
- **Infrastructure Realignment**: `contracts/` and `infra/` moved to `2_areas/` to satisfy Red Regnant hard-gates.
- **Root Purge**: Removed `audit/`, `reports/`, and stray config files from the cleanroom root.

## 🚨 4. Current Blockers & Risks
1. **Mastra Schema Friction**: Tool argument wrapping is breaking Zod validation in linear workflows.
2. **Mutation Gaps**: Stryker cannot currently run on kinetic components without potential API key leaks; needs local hardening.
3. **Theater Persistence**: High volumes of placeholder or "cosmetic" code were detected in the 64-module incarnation; demotions are ongoing until 88% mutation threshold is met.

**Next Pulse**: Hardening Port 1 Interlock and Port 6 Storage.
