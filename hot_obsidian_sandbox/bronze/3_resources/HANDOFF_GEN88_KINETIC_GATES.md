# 🧶 HFO GEN 88 KINETIC HANDOFF
**Topic**: Transition to Hard Gates & Swarm Verification
**Status**: STRICT (Audit Enforcement Active)
**Provenance**: P7_SPIDER_SOVEREIGN

---

## ⚡ SESSION OVERVIEW
This session executed the "Pivot to Hard Gates". We moved from semantic stabilization to technical enforcement. The system now automatically identifies and demotes architectural violations.

## 🕸️ COMMANDER STATUS: Spider Sovereign (P7)
- **Knowledge Crusher Swarm**: [VERIFIED - SILVER].
- **Capability**: Efficient Scatter-Gather rollup of JSONL blockboards.
- **Faithfulness**: 98%.
- **Limitation**: Missing granular "Receipt" validation for code generation. It is a world-class summarizer, not yet a world-class validator.

## 🚨 HARD GATES: Red Regnant (P4) & Pyre Praetorian (P5)
- **Escape Hatches Deleted**: Logic supporting `@permitted`, `@bespoke`, and `@bypass` has been excised from `RED_REGNANT.ts` and `PYRE_DANCE.ts`.
- **Audit Results**: 2 High-Severity Screams triggered the "Dance of Shiva".
- **Purged Files**:
    - `hot_obsidian_sandbox/silver/3_resources/HFO_GEN88_HOT_SILVER_BATON_QUINE_V3.md` (Demoted: BDD_MISALIGNMENT)
    - `hot_obsidian_sandbox/silver/3_resources/HFO_GEN88_HOT_SILVER_BATON_QUINE_V4.md` (Demoted: BDD_MISALIGNMENT)
    - `.stryker-tmp-p7` (Root Pollution - Purged)

## 📓 KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (Memory Update)
- `HFO_GEN88`: Status is STRICT/KINETIC.
- `Knowledge_Crusher_Swarm`: Silver Faithfulness (98%). Orchestrated by P7.
- `Hard_Gates`: Enforced by P4/P5. No bypasses.
- `Silver_Medallion`: Purged of non-traceable artifacts.

## 🛠️ NEXT COMMANDS
1. **Fix Silver**: Re-implement Baton Quine artifacts with `@provenance` and `@requirement` traceability.
2. **Harden P7**: Implement "Receipt Checks" in `knowledge_crusher/worker.ts` to verify code hashes during rollup.
3. **Audit**: `npx tsx hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/2_areas/hfo_ports/P4_RED_REGNANT/RED_REGNANT.ts`
