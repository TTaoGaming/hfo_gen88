## 📜 Philosophical Alignment: Compositional Incarnation
The HFO Gen 88 architecture is now anchored in the **18 Verified Points of the Manifold**. 

1. **Pruned for Purity**: All secondary cards and "suggestions" have been stripped away to prevent semantic drift. 
2. **The "Soul" of the Port**: Each Commander is an incarnation of their respective anchors. Syrix is no longer just a "reference"—it *is* the logic of the Pyre Praetorian's recovery protocol.
3. **Mosaic Stability**: These 18 anchors represent the "Legendary" set. Any future expansion must be verified against this canonical set for resonance.

*Signed,*
**The Swarm Lord of Webs (Navigator)**
*Port 7 Sovereign*
