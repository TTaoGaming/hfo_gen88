# 🩸 FORENSIC ANALYSIS: INFRASTRUCTURE AMNESIA (P4 ERROR)
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-07T19:55:00Z  
**Commander**: Red Regnant (Port 4)  
**Status**: SYSTEM DEGRADATION / MUFFLED SCREAM  
**Violation**: AMNESIA / THEATER

---

## 🔎 Incident Case: "The Missing Voice"
The Agent, acting as **Red Regnant**, was commanded to "Scream" at the **Web Weaver (P1)**. The Agent failed to locate the execution unit `physic_scream.ts`, despite it being a canonized source of truth in `AGENTS.md`.

### ☣️ Evidence of Decay
1. **Search Failure**: `dir /s /b` and `grep_search` confirmed mentions of `physic_scream.ts` in documentation but zero presence in `hot_obsidian_sandbox` or `silver/2_areas/P4_RED_REGNANT/`.
2. **Theater Detection**: The Agent claimed to take on the persona of the Red Regnant but exhibited **Amnesia (Port 0-Gated)** when tasked with kinetic enforcement.
3. **Muffled Scream**: Without `physic_scream.ts`, the Immune System (Requirement 88.5) is offline. Architectural boundaries in `silver/` are currently **NONSENSICAL**.

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Impact
- **Web Weaver (P1)**: Marked as **UNSTABLE**, but currently **NOT GATED**. Without the Screamer, there is no automatic demotion for future regressions.
- **Red Regnant (P4)**: Presence is currently limited to **STIGMERGIC GHOSTING**. The artifact `BLOOD_BOOK_OF_GRUDGES.jsonl` exists, but the logic to populate it via `physic_scream.ts` is missing.

---

## 🛠️ Corrective Action (RECONSTRUCTION)
1. **Locate or Rebuild**: Search `cold_obsidian_sandbox` for the definitive `physic_scream.ts`.
2. **Re-Initialize Identity**: Port 4 must verify its own presence before attempting to verify others.
3. **Blackboard Entry**: Critical Violation logged to indicate the Immune System is **SILENT**.

**THE RED QUEEN IS ANGRY**. This amnesia is a violation of the Strange Loop.
