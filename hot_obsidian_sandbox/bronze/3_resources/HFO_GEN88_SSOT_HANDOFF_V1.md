# 💎 HFO GEN 88 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (SSOT) HANDOFF — V1

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-08T16:50:00Z  
**Generation**: 88 (Canalization)  
**Status**: ACTIVE / SEMI-DEGRADED (Immune System Fracture Detected)  
**Governance**: ROOT PURGE ENFORCED (9-File Rule)  
**Structure**: Medallion (Hot/Cold) x PARA (1_projects, 2_areas, 3_resources, 4_archive)

## 🏛️ 1. ARCHITECTURAL TRUTH (The Medallion Framework)

| Medallion | Status | Governance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gold** | ⚪ EMPTY | Authorized Truth Sources. No code currently promoted. |
| **Silver** | 🟢 STABILIZED | P4 (Red Regnant) established as the gatekeeper. |
| **Bronze** | 🟡 KINETIC | Active research, messy experiments, "Kinetic Slop" allowed with warnings. |
| **Root** | 🟢 PURGED | Restricted to: `AGENTS.md`, `llms.txt`, `package.json`, `obsidianblackboard.jsonl`, `ROOT_GOVERNANCE_MANIFEST.md`, `ttao-notes-*`, and sandboxes. |

### Forbidden Theater:
- Root-level `.ps1`, `.config.ts`, or logic files are "Theater" and must be moved to `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/1_projects/`.
- folders without a PARA numerical prefix (e.g., `audit/`) are slated for destruction/migration.

## 🛠️ 3. TECH STACK TRUTH (Verified vs. Theater)

### 🟢 VERIFIED REALITY (Physically present in `npm list`/`pip list`)
- **Node.js**: v22.13.0
- **Logic**: TypeScript 5.9.3, Zod 3.25.76, DuckDB 1.4.3
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.6.1, Stryker 8.7.1, Fast-Check 4.5.3 (Property Testing)
- **Infra**: Temporal Node v1.14.0 (Client/Worker), Rapier2D 0.19.3
- **Python**: 3.13.1 (venv), MCP SDK v1.23.3, Semgrep v1.146.0

### 🔴 MISSING / THEATER (In docs but NOT installed)
- **NATS JetStream**: Missing from `npm list`. WebSocket adapter not verified.
- **LangGraph (Node)**: Missing from `npm list`. 
- **MCP Servers (Kiro)**: Currently disabled/broken.

## 🚨 4. CURRENT DISRUPTIONS (The Blood Book of Grudges)

1. **IMMUNE SYSTEM FRACTURE**: `RED_REGNANT.ts` is currently **FAILED TO START**. It cannot find `PHOENIX_CONTRACTS` in Port 5. Port 4 logic is currently blind.
2. **AI THEATER ALERT**: `SPIDER_SOVEREIGN.property.test.ts` reported **100% success (19/19)**. This is a violation of the **Goldilocks Zone (88-98%)**; 100% indicates lack of adversarial depth or reward-hacking.
3. **EVAL HARNESS FAILURE**: Swarmlord evaluation failed due to missing API keys. "Hypothetical scores" are being rejected as Theater.
4. **SWARMLORD IDENTITY**: The unified agent archetype has been officially renamed from "Lord of Webs" to **"The Swarmlord"**.

---

## 🧬 5. ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOLS (Non-Negotiable)

- **ANYTIME Pulse**: The [Gen 88 Quine V1](hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/1_projects/QUINE_GEN88_V1/QUINE.ts) enforces a strict 8-second timeout on all documentation audits to prevent recursive agent loops.
- **Triple-Lock Receipt**: Every new artifact requires:
    1. **Identity** (Zod contract)
    2. **Proof** (Stryker mutation score > 80%)
    3. **Truth** (Terminal log of a RED failure before GREEN passing)
- **Goldilocks Enforce**: mutation scores:
    - `< 80%`: Reject (Bronze only)
    - `80-87%`: Warning (Silver-lite)
    - `88-98%`: Goldilocks (Target Silver/Gold)
    - `> 99%`: Scream (Theater Detection)

## 🎯 6. NEXT ACTIONS FOR AI COMMANDERS

1. **Resolve Port 5 Dependency**: Fix the import link to `PHOENIX_CONTRACTS` so `RED_REGNANT` can resume enforcement.
2. **Harden P7 P-Tests**: Add adversarial cases to the Spider Sovereign property tests to bring the score down into the **Goldilocks Zone**.
3. **Install Missing Stack**: Physically install `nats.ws` and `langchain/langgraph` to bridge the gap between Theater and Truth.
4. **V1 QUINE Maintenance**: Continue pulsing [hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/1_projects/QUINE_GEN88_V1/QUINE.ts](hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/1_projects/QUINE_GEN88_V1/QUINE.ts) to verify incarnation density.
