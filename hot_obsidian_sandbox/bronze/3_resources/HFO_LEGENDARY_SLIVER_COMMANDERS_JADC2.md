## 🧬 JADC2 Functional Alignment (Tertiary Layer)

### **Port 0: Lidless Legion (Synapse Sliver)**
- **Role**: Strategic ISR Sensation.
- **Mechanism**: Drawing cards on combat damage represents the tactical feeding of environmental signals back into the hive's awareness. The synapse is the entry point of truth.

### **Port 1: Web Weaver (Gemhide Sliver)**
- **Role**: Data Fabric Connectivity.
- **Mechanism**: Transforming every hive member into a mana producer represents the ability of the FUSE layer to turn any raw data point into a usable resource for the larger orchestration.

### **Port 2: Mirror Magus (Mirror Entity)**
- **Role**: Digital Twin Invariance / Morphogenesis.
- **Mechanism**: Mirror Entity represents the ultimate morphological transformation. By setting the base power, toughness, and types of the entire hive, it simulates the "Propagation of Alternatives" within the Digital Twin manifold. It is the semiotic anchor for SHAPE.

### **Port 3: Spore Storm (The First Sliver)**
- **Role**: High-Velocity Action Injection.
- **Mechanism**: Cascade allows for a single action to trigger a recursive sequence of events (Swarm Injection). When the Spore Storm fires, the entire ordnance manifold follows.

### **Port 4: Red Regnant (Sliver Queen)**
- **Role**: Asymmetric Disruption / Electronic Warfare.
- **Mechanism**: The ability to instantly generate new slivers (chaos nodes) at will creates a state of infinite entropy for the adversary (AI Theater/Legacy Hardware), overwhelming their logic.

### **Port 5: Pyre Praetorian (Sliver Hivelord)**
- **Role**: Force Protection / System Hardening.
- **Mechanism**: Indestructibility represents the final state of the Medalion's Silver/Gold promotion. Once immunized by the Praetorian, the artifact cannot be decomposed by technical debt. This layer covers the primary defense, while the Shroud-equivalent logic (Crystalline) is absorbed into the Shield's broader protective scope.

### **Port 6: Kraken Keeper (Dormant Sliver)**
- **Role**: Knowledge Repository / Asset Hibernation.
- **Mechanism**: Drawing cards when slivers enter the battlefield represents the assimilation of interactive history into cold storage. Port 6 turns every active pulse into a permanent knowledge asset.

### **Port 7: Spider Sovereign (Sliver Overlord)**
- **Role**: Multi-Domain Command & Control (C2).
- **Mechanism**: The power to search the library for any sliver and take control of others represents the Sovereign's ability to navigate the complex agentic manifold and orchestrate all ports.
