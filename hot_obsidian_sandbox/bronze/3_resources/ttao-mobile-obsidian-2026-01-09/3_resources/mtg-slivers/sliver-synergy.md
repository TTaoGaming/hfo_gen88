# 🧬 Sliver-Synergy Mechanics
**Reference**: MTG → HFO Mapping
**Layer**: 3_resources (Knowledge)

## Why Slivers?

> Every Sliver shares its ability with ALL other Slivers.

This is the perfect metaphor for HFO's architecture:
- **Composable AI Agents**: Each port grants capabilities to all others
- **Emergent Behavior**: Simple rules → complex swarm intelligence
- **Resilient Architecture**: No single point of failure
- **Stigmergic Coordination**: Indirect communication through shared state

## The Pureblood Sliver Mapping

| Port | Commander | Primary Sliver | Ability |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| P0 | Lidless Legion | Synapse Sliver | Draw on damage |
| P1 | Web Weaver | Gemhide Sliver | Tap for any mana |
| P2 | Mirror Magus | Mirror Entity | Transform all |
| P3 | Spore Storm | The First Sliver | Cascade |
| P4 | Red Regnant | Sliver Queen | Instant tokens |
| P5 | Pyre Praetorian | Sliver Hivelord | Indestructible |
| P6 | Kraken Keeper | Dormant Sliver | Draw on ETB |
| P7 | Spider Sovereign | Sliver Overlord | Search & control |

## Mechanical Justifications

### P0: Synapse Sliver (SENSE)
"Whenever a Sliver deals combat damage to a player, draw a card."
→ Every "touch" returns data to the hive.
→ The synapse is the entry point of truth.

### P1: Gemhide Sliver (FUSE)
"All Slivers have 'Tap: Add one mana of any color.'"
→ Every agent contributes to the power pool.
→ Ultimate fusion of resources.

### P2: Mirror Entity (SHAPE)
"X: Creatures you control become every type with base P/T X/X."
→ Transform the entire swarm as needed.
→ Propagation of Alternatives.

### P3: The First Sliver (DELIVER)
"Cascade"
→ One action triggers recursive injections.
→ When Spore Storm fires, the ordnance follows.

### P4: Sliver Queen (DISRUPT)
"2: Create a 1/1 Sliver token."
→ Instant chaos node generation.
→ Infinite entropy for adversaries.

### P5: Sliver Hivelord (DEFEND)
"Slivers you control have indestructible."
→ Ultimate system hardening.
→ Cannot be decomposed by technical debt.

### P6: Dormant Sliver (STORE)
"Slivers have defender and 'ETB: Draw a card.'"
→ Every pulse becomes a knowledge asset.
→ Assimilation into cold storage.

### P7: Sliver Overlord (NAVIGATE)
"3: Search library for a Sliver. 3: Gain control of target Sliver."
→ Navigate the code library.
→ Fetch the right tool for the job.

## Secondary Slivers

| Port | Secondary | Ability | Function |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| P0 | Telekinetic | Tap to tap | Remote sensing |
| P1 | Manaweft | Tap for mana | Redundant fusion |
| P2 | Shifting | Unblockable by non-Slivers | Frictionless paths |
| P3 | Bonescythe | Double strike | Maximum impact |
| P4 | Necrotic | Sacrifice to destroy | Scream protocol |
| P5 | Crystalline | Shroud | Targeted protection |
| P6 | Pulmonic | Return to library | State recovery |
| P7 | Sliver Legion | +1/+1 per Sliver | Exponential power |

## The Hive Mind Principle

> "The Hive does not think; it remembers.
> Every Sliver is a synaptic link in the Mosaic of War."
