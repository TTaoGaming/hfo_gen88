# P2: Mirror Magus
**Verb**: SHAPE
**HIVE Phase**: V (Validate)
**JADC2 Role**: Digital Twin Tile

## MTG Anchors

| Tier | Card | Mechanic |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Primary | Sakashima of a Thousand Faces | Clone without legend rule |
| Secondary | Orvar, the All-Form | Copy on target |
| Sliver | Mirror Entity | Transform all creatures |

## Function

> As the **Shadow Object**, I maintain a high-fidelity digital twin
> so that Courses of Action can be simulated at machine speed.

## V10 Role (Physics Cursor)

- Rapier.js / Rapier.rs (Wasm)
- Inertia & smoothing calculations
- Snap-lock to Point of Interest
- Kalman predictive filter
- Cursor morphogenesis

---

## Sliver Mechanic

**Mirror Entity**: "X: Until end of turn, creatures you control become every creature type and have base power and toughness X/X."

→ Transform the entire swarm into whatever is needed.
→ Propagation of Alternatives within Digital Twin manifold.

## Mission Thread

```gherkin
Given the Shadow Object Host maintains virtual transform
And the Morphic Modeler simulates physics-compliant bounds
When movement telemetry is updated
Then generate machine-speed COAs for cursor positioning
And adapt engagement profile to negate OS collisions
```

---

## Key Insight

> The Physics Cursor is a **Digital Twin** of the fingertip.
> It coexists with the OS cursor without collision.
> Sakashima bypasses the "legend rule" (mouse-lock).
