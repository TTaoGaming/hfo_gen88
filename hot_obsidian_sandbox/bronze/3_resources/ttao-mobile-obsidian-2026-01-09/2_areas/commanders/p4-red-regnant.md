## V10 Role (Physics Cursor)

- OS mouse interference suppression
- Jitter attack mitigation
- Hardware-lock sequence
- Native signal rejection
- Virtual chain dominance

## Sliver Mechanic

**Sliver Queen**: "2: Create a 1/1 colorless Sliver creature token."

→ Instantly generate chaos nodes at will.
→ Infinite entropy for the adversary.
→ Overwhelms AI Theater / Legacy Hardware.

## The Scream Protocol

When architectural violations are detected:
1. Log to `BLOOD_BOOK_OF_GRUDGES.jsonl`
2. Trigger recursive shroud
3. Force system re-alignment
4. Vaporize obstacles via sacrifice

## Mission Thread

```gherkin
Given the EW Module identifies physical interrupt noise
And the Complexity Engine generates masking noise
When native hardware attempts to override virtual manifold
Then suppress physical interrupt resonance
And ensure virtual chain maintains dominance
```
