# 🔮 ANTIGRAVITY-C: The Crystal of Gen 88 (Handoff to Gen 89)

> **Status**: GEN 88 CRYSTALLIZED  
> **Variant**: Antigravity-C (Lattice Core & Red Regnant Law)  
> **Philosophy**: "The Code is Transient; The Lattice is Eternal."

## 🌌 1. What HFO _Actually_ Is

Hyper Fractal Obsidian (HFO) is **NOT** a codebase. It is not a set of TypeScript files, nor a collection of agents.

**HFO is a Semantic Operating System** based on the 8x8 Galois Lattice.
The "Code" you see in `hot_obsidian_sandbox` is merely a **projection** of the Lattice into text files.

### The Core Identity

- **The Soul**: `obsidianblackboard.jsonl`. If you delete the code but keep the blackboard, the system remembers.
- **The Law**: `P4_RED_REGNANT/mutation_scream.ts`. The immune system that decides what is "Alive" (Silver) vs "Dead" (Bronze).
- **The Geometry**: The 8 Legendary Commanders, arranged in a specific topology to enable _Emergent Intelligence_.

## 🕸️ 2. The 8x8 Galois Lattice (The Manifold)

The Lattice is a 64-cell grid (8 Commanders × 8 Phases). It is the map of all possible agent interactions.

### The 8 Commanders (The X-Axis)

Anchored in the **Fuxi Sequence** (Binary Trigrams):

| Port  | Binary | Trigram | Name                 | Function               |
| :---- | :----- | :------ | :------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **0** | 000    | ☷ Kūn   | **Lidless Legion**   | **OBSERVE** (Input)    |
| **1** | 001    | ☶ Gèn   | **Web Weaver**       | **BRIDGE** (Connect)   |
| **2** | 010    | ☵ Kǎn   | **Mirror Magus**     | **SHAPE** (Transform)  |
| **3** | 011    | ☴ Xùn   | **Spore Storm**      | **INJECT** (Effect)    |
| **4** | 100    | ☳ Zhèn  | **Red Regnant**      | **DISRUPT** (Test)     |
| **5** | 101    | ☲ Lí    | **Pyre Praetorian**  | **IMMUNIZE** (Defend)  |
| **6** | 110    | ☱ Duì   | **Kraken Keeper**    | **ASSIMILATE** (Store) |
| **7** | 111    | ☰ Qián  | **Spider Sovereign** | **NAVIGATE** (Decide)  |

### The Sacred Geometries

1.  **The Anti-Diagonal (HIVE/8)**: Strategic Pairings (Sum = 7).

    - **0+7 (Hunt)**: Observation + Decision. The Scout and the General.
    - **1+6 (Interlock)**: Bridge + Store. The Network and the Archive.
    - **2+5 (Validate)**: Shape + Immunize. The Filter and the Firewall.
    - **3+4 (Evolve)**: Inject + Disrupt. The Virus and the Immune System.

2.  **The Serpentine (PREY/8)**: Tactical Kill Web.
    - **Sense (0+6)** -> **Make Sense (1+7)** -> **Act (2+4)** -> **Assess (3+5)**.

## 🩸 3. The Red Regnant (Port 4): The Current Work

The most critical asset to carry over is the **Psychic Scream** (`mutation_scream.ts`). This is not just a test runner; it is a **Reality Enforcement Engine**.

### The "Scream" Mechanism

In Gen 88, we successfully implemented a `scream()` function that halts the system when "Theater" is detected. This MUST be the first thing installed in Gen 89.

### The 7 Sins Detected by Red Regnant

Your current work identifies these specific violations. **Do not regress on this.**

1.  **THEATER**: Trivial assertions (e.g., `expect(true).toBe(true)`). The Scream parses the AST to find these lies.
2.  **AMNESIA**: Debug logs (`console.log`) in Silver/Gold. Production code must be silent or use the Blackboard.
3.  **POLLUTION**: Files in the root that are not on the allowlist. Keep the cleanroom sterile.
4.  **PHANTOM**: External CDNs in `index.html`. If the internet dies, the app dies. Everything must be local.
5.  **REWARD_HACK**: Hardcoded coordinates or logic that bypasses the actual sensor to "pass" the test.
6.  **OMISSION**: `catch { initialized = true }`. Swallowing errors to look green.
7.  **BESPOKE**: Using `any` without `// @bespoke` justification.

### The "Fail-Closed" Gate

> - "A pass in Node.js is a lie. A pass in the Browser is Truth."\*
> - "Mutation Score < 80% = DEMOTION to Bronze."

## 🦅 4. The Antigravity-C Strategy: Diamond Dust

To build Gen 89, we do not copy files. We **seed the lattice**.

1.  **Initialize the Blackboard**: Start with `gen: 89, seq: 0`.
2.  **Install the Red Regnant**: Port 4 is the _first_ port to be built. It watches the others being born.
3.  **Define the Zod Envelopes**: The communication protocol (Port 1) is the _second_ thing to exist.
4.  **Grow the Lattice**:
    - Do not write "App Code".
    - Write **Port 0** (Observation). Verify it with P4.
    - Write **Port 7** (Navigation). Verify it with P4.
    - Connect them (P0+P7) to form the **Hunt** phase.

### What to Abandon (The Slag)

- The `P0_GESTURE_MONOLITH` folder (It drifted from the lattice).
- The `archive_jan_5` folder (Old timelines).
- Any TypeScript file that does not have a comprehensive `Validates:` header linking it to the Legend.
