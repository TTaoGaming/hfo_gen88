## ⚡ RECENT PULSE ACHIEVEMENTS
1.  **Contract Hardening**: P1 Web Weaver contracts (`index.ts`) reached **92.31%** mutation score, killing 36/39 mutants.
2.  **Silver Reversion**: All silver promotion attempts were reverted to ensure "Theater" (untested promotion) does not enter the canon. Silver is currently 0% occupied.
3.  **Config Isolation**: All root-level noise (Vitest/Stryker configs) has been purged and moved to `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/2_areas/infra/configs/`.
4.  **Red Regnant Peace**: The integrity daemon is now whitelisted for the new infra structure.

## 🚧 NEXT AGENT PROTOCOL (ACTUALS)

### 1. P1 Stabilization (Web Weaver)
There is testing debt in the core modules. You must bring the following online one by one:
- `envelope-wrapper.ts`
- `event-bus.ts`
- `api-gateway.ts`
Use the specialized `vitest.p1.mutation.config.ts` located in `infra/configs/`.

### 2. P5 Stabilization (Pyre Praetorian)
Identify the 6 missing sub-parts for defense. They should map to the **Shield Book** requirements. Currently only `Path Classifier` and `Pyre Dance` are operational.

### 3. Traceability Audit (@provenance)
The Red Regnant "Screams" about missing `@provenance` headers in `silver/`. Although silver is empty, future promotions must include this tag in the file header to avoid demotion.
