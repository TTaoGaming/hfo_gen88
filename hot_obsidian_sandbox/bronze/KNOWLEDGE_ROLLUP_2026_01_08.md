# Knowledge Rollup: HFO Gen 88 Stabilization (2026-01-08)

## 📌 Metadata
- **Timestamp**: 2026-01-08T23:30:00Z
- **Generation**: 88 (Canalization)
- **Status**: HOT BRONZE CONSOLIDATION
- **Medallion**: Bronze (Hot)
- **Commander**: Spider Sovereign (Port 7)

---

## 🏗️ Executive Summary
Today's operations focused on the "Physics Cursor Vertical Slice" and the aggressive stabilization of the HFO Gen 88 architecture. Significant strides were made in agent persistence (Sovereign Soul) and P1 Contract Hardening, but a critical audit by **Red Regnant (Port 4)** triggered a mass demotion of Silver artifacts back to Bronze due to PARA violations and "archive pollution".

## 🧪 Mutation Scoring & Performance

| Port | Artifact | Score | Status | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1** | Web Weaver | 89.16% | 🟡 BRONZE | Was Silver; demoted after 91-count audit failure. |
| **P4** | Red Regnant | N/A | 🟡 BRONZE | Demoted after archive pollution discovery. |
| **P5** | Pyre Praetorian | 26.73% | 🔴 CRITICAL | "Hollow Wings" - 38/101 mutants have NO COVERAGE. |
| **P7** | Spider Sovereign | Verified | 🟢 FUNCTIONAL | Knowledge Crusher verified; LibSQL persistence active. |

## 🚨 Red Regnant Screams & Contradictions (FLAGGED)

> **CRITICAL**: The following claims of "Silver" status are currently **INVALIDATED** by the Port 4 Blood Book of Grudges.

1.  **CLAIM**: "Port 1 and Port 4 are Silver compliant."
    - **REALITY**: **DEMOTED**. A 91-count audit failure and discoveries of "archive pollution" in `silver/4_archive/` forced a rollback to Bronze.
    - **SCREAM**: "Bronze audit detected 240 disruptions. Starting stabilization."
2.  **CLAIM**: "System defense is hardening."
    - **REALITY**: **PYRE FAILURE**. P5 mutation score is at a catastrophic **26.73%**.
    - **SCREAM**: "ABYSSAL_FAILURE: Pyre Praetorian wings are hollow... 38 mutants have NO COVERAGE."
3.  **CLAIM**: "PARA Alignment is complete."
    - **REALITY**: **BDD MISALIGNMENT**. Multiple infra configs and scripts (e.g., [hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/2_areas/infra/configs/vitest.context7.config.ts](hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/2_areas/infra/configs/vitest.context7.config.ts)) are missing requirement traceability (`Validates:` or `@provenance`).

## 🕷️ Spider Sovereign (Port 7) Progress
- **Sovereign Soul (Persistence)**: Successfully established hard-state persistence via LibSQL.
- **Legion Recall**: Verified that 1 Meta + 8 Commander states can successfully persist and share synaptic context across restarts.
- **Mastra Integration**: Resolved the `saveMessages` method gap by swapping `MastraMemory` for a custom `Memory` implementation.
- **Galois Lattice**: Solidified the 8x8 Galois Lattice and Fractal Octree Heartbeat.

---

## 🛠️ Active Workfronts
- **[P5 Hardening]**: Aggressive test suite expansion for Pyre Praetorian to reach the 88% Goldilocks threshold.
- **[Root Purge]**: Finalizing PARA alignment and removing unauthorized debug logs (`AMNESIA` violations).
- **[Knowledge Crusher]**: Transitioning the swarm to "Hard Gates" to close granularity and receipt gaps.
