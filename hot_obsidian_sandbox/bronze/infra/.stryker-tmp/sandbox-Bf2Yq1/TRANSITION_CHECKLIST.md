# 🚀 TRANSITION CHECKLIST — Gen 87.X3 to Gen 88

> **Generation**: 88 | **Status**: PENDING | **Date**: 2026-01-04
> **Source**: Gen 87.X3.4 GOLD Manifest

---

## 🏁 Phase 0: Forensic Baseline (COMPLETE)
- [x] **Audit Pain Registry**: Recover all 25+ ancestral failure modes.
- [x] **Verify DuckDB Coverage**: Achieve 100% pattern matching against historical memory.
- [x] **Document Antidotes**: Map every pain to a Gen 88 "Straitjacket" rule.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] **Initialize Gen 88 Directory**: Create `hot/gold`, `hot/silver`, `hot/bronze`.
- [ ] **Port Manifests**: Copy and mutate Gen 87 `MANIFEST.md` into Gen 88 format.
- [ ] **Configure MCP Servers**: Ensure all 6 core MCP servers are active and authorized.
- [ ] **Setup Stigmergy Blackboard**: Initialize `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` in the root.

---

## 🕷️ Phase 2: Agent Persona Mapping
- [ ] **Inject AGENTS_GEN88.md**: Update system prompts with the 8 Legendary Commanders.
- [ ] **Verify Port Access**: Test that Port 0 (Lidless Legion) can access Tavily and Port 6 (Kraken Keeper) can access DuckDB.
- [ ] **Enforce Canalization**: Set up file-system gates to prevent "Theater" (e.g., read-only `_archive`).

---

## 🧪 Phase 3: Red Proof Initialization
- [ ] **Define Port 0 Spec**: Create the first formal spec for the "SENSE" verb.
- [ ] **Write First Red Test**: Create a failing Playwright test for the W3C Pointer Adapter.
- [ ] **Verify Red Phase**: Ensure the system refuses to implement code until the test fails.

---

## 👑 Phase 4: Gold Tier Convergence
- [ ] **Migrate Gold Artifacts**: Move `HFO_PHOENIX_PROTOCOL` and `HFO_OBSIDIAN_PROTOCOL` to `hot/gold/`.
- [ ] **Run Quine Verification**: Ensure the Gen 88 manifest can self-describe and regenerate.
- [ ] **Signal Readiness**: Final handoff to the Spider Sovereign for Gen 88 execution.

---

## 🚨 Critical Success Metrics
1. **V/H Ratio > 1.5**: Verification rate must exceed Hallucination rate.
2. **Zero Theater**: No hardcoded success messages in logs.
3. **100% CDD**: All new code must have a Zod/Pydantic contract.
