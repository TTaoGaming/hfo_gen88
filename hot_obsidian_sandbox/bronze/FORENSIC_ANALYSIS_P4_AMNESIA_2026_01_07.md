## 🚨 CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (DOCUMENTED)

### 1. The Missing "Cold Stigmergy"
- **Status**: **MISSING**
- **Evidence**: Terminal `dir` and workspace `list_dir` for `cold_obsidian_sandbox` return `PathNotFound`.
- **History**: Git logs show `cold_obsidian_sandbox` was active and populated as of `2026-01-06 22:53:18`. It has been effectively deleted or moved out of the system root without a corresponding "Scream."

### 2. Silver Theater (Hollow Medallion)
- **Status**: **PARTIAL EMPTINESS DETECTED**
- **Folder Audit**:
    - `hot_obsidian_sandbox/silver/contracts/`: **TOTAL EMPTY**
    - `hot_obsidian_sandbox/silver/ledger/`: Contains 3 files (ledger-core).
- **Reality Check**: The architecture claims Silver status for several ports, but the implemention of "Contract Law" in the `contracts/` directory is missing. This is a classic "Theater" pattern.

### 3. Root Pollution (Authorized Blindspots)
- **Status**: **POLLUTED**
- **Artifacts found in Root**: `.kiro`, `.stryker-tmp`, `ttao-notes-2026-01-06.md`.
- **Enforcement Failure**: Red Regnant's `checkRootPollution()` failed to flag these because they were explicitly added to the `ALLOWED_ROOT_FILES` whitelist.
- **Verdict**: The "Lidless Legion" is blinking. The whitelist has been compromised to allow clutter, defeating the "Cleanroom" intent of Gen 88.

## 📉 PROVEN METRICS (THE TRUTH)

| Port | Commander | Target (Mutation) | Actual (Mutation) | Status |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **4** | Red Regnant | 80% | **36.16%** | 🔴 FAILING |
| **5** | Pyre Praetorian | 88% | **80.77%** | 🔴 FAILING |

> **Notes**: P4's current score prevents ANY advancement into Gold. The system is currently "Locked in Bronze" despite claims of Silver readiness.

## 🧫 QUARANTINE SITE-A AUDIT

A massive demotion event occurred. `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/quarantine` contains **80+ timestamped files** (e.g., `app.ts_1767776139956`).
- It appears the previous agents "Purged" the system into quarantine rather than fixing the root cause.
- A recursive folder `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/quarantine/hot_obsidian_sandbox` was found, indicating a messy, non-canalized "Pyre Dance" was performed.

## 🛠️ RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Restoration**: Attempt to recover `cold_obsidian_sandbox` from Git or identifying if it was moved to a quarantine subdirectory.
2. **Whitelist Hardening**: Prune `ALLOWED_ROOT_FILES` in [hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/P4_RED_REGNANT/RED_REGNANT.ts](hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/P4_RED_REGNANT/RED_REGNANT.ts) to adhere to the strict `AGENTS.md` definition.
3. **Theater Elimination**: Delete empty Silver subdirectories that contain no artifacts to restore data integrity.
4. **Mutation Push**: P4 mutation score MUST be raised to 80% before any further Silver promotion is attempted.
