# 🛸 ANTIGRAVITY LATTICE — GROUNDING & ALIGNMENT REPORT [2026-01-05T19:27:23-07:00]

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE GROUNDING: THE 8x8 MANIFOLD

This report evaluates the **HFO Gen 88** system's fidelity to the **8x8 Galois Lattice**. We define the current state by measuring the "Tension" between the **Narrative Vision** (The 64-Card Deck) and the **Grounded Reality** (The Buildable Swarm).

## 🕸️ THE GALOIS LATTICE: ALIGNMENT MATRIX

The system is structurally anchored in three primary patterns within the 64-cell manifold.

### 1. THE ANTI-DIAGONAL (HIVE/8 Strategic Loop) — [ALIGNMENT: 40%]

_Pairing X + Y = 7. Strategic PDCA/TDD lifecycle._

| Phase | Port Pair | Status         | Alignment Status                                                        |
| :---: | :-------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **H** | 0 + 7     | **BRONZE**     | Senses targets (P0) but P7 decisioning is theoretical.                  |
| **I** | 1 + 6     | **BRONZE**     | Contracts defined in `contracts/`, but DuckDB (P6) is in Quarantine.    |
| **V** | 2 + 5     | **BRONZE**     | SHAPE (P2) is active in Monolith, but Pyre Gates (P5) are not enforced. |
| **E** | 3 + 4     | **SILVER (1)** | **MAX ALIGNMENT**. Red Regnant (P4) is active in Silver.                |

### 2. THE SERPENTINE (PREY/8 Tactical Loop) — [ALIGNMENT: 60%]

_Tactical JADC2 "Kill Web" execution._

The **Gesture Pipeline** represents a functional PREY loop:

- **P (Perceive)**: MediaPipe sensor ingestion (P0/P6).
- **R (React)**: OneEuro Filtering & FSM decisioning (P1/P7).
- **E (Execute)**: Rapier2D Physics smoothing (P2/P4).
- **Y (Yield)**: W3C Pointer Event emission (P3/P5).

### 3. THE DIAGONAL (Self-Referential Quines) — [ALIGNMENT: 20%]

_Legendary Commanders acting on themselves. Meta-optimization._

Only **(4,4) — DISRUPT the DISRUPT** is currently aligned via Stryker mutation testing of the test suite in Silver. Other self-referential quines (e.g., P0 sensing P0) are dormant.

## ⚖️ DRIFT ANALYSIS: Narrative vs. Grounded

### 🌊 MONOLITHIC DRIFT (P2-P4 Drift)

The `gesture-pipeline.ts` is an intentional drift from the 8-port architecture.

- **Drift Marker**: Line 6 explicitly states: _"No hexagons. No ports. Just functions that call functions."_
- **Reason**: Performance and "Kinetic Energy" in early Gen 88 prototyping.
- **Hazard**: Bypasses the "Psychic Scream" gates, creating a "Theater of Compliance" where logic passes but lacks formal lattice grounding.

### 🛡️ QUARANTINE DRIFT (L2-L6 Drift)

While the **Obsidian Hourglass** (Port 7) and **V9 Specifications** are conceptually aligned, the physical implementation is "Heavy in Quarantine."

- **Drift**: The 8 ports are implemented in `quarantine/silver/` but fail the **Medallion Promotion Gate**.
- **Blocker**: Lack of **VacuoleEnvelope** compliance and low mutation kill rates in P0, P1, P3, P5, P6, and P7.

### 📜 NARRATIVE DRIFT

The "64 MTG Narrative Cards" are currently "Visions" (V1-V8) which V9 is actively "Grounding" into buildable TypeScript types.

- **Alignment**: The mapping of Commander archetypes (Lolth, Sauron, Elesh Norn) to technical roles is 100% consistent.
- **Drift**: The physical 64-card deck is not yet represented as a machine-enforceable artifact in the `bronze` root.

## 🔮 PROGNOSTIC: RE-ALIGNMENT STRATEGY

To pull Gen 88 out of drift and into Lattice-alignment:

1. **Fractonate the Monolith**: Decouple the Gesture Pipeline into its constituent Ports (P0, P2, P7).
2. **Zero-Trust Promotion**: Only promote `contracts/envelope.ts` to Silver to force all Quarantine artifacts to use the standard wrapper.
3. **Close the Anti-Diagonal**: Prioritize the **V (Validate)** phase (Port 2 + 5) implementation in Silver to complement the existing Port 4 enforcement.
