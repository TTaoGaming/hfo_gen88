## 1. The Canalization Stack (Enforcement Layers)

We do not trust the AI to "do the right thing." We build canals so that the *only* thing it can do is the right thing.

| Layer | Name | Enforcement Mechanism | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **L6** | **Contract Law** | Zod Schemas (Hard runtime crash) | 🟢 ACTIVE |
| **L5** | **GitOps Guards** | GitHub Actions / Branch Protection | 🟢 ACTIVE |
| **L4** | **Pre-commit** | Husky / Lint-staged (Blocks commit) | 🟡 PENDING |
| **L3** | **Manual Gates** | `promote.ps1` (Requires human/AI verification) | 🟡 PENDING |
| **L2** | **Immune System** | `screamer.ts` (Scheduled demotion/quarantine) | 🟢 ACTIVE |
| **L1** | **Steering Files** | `AGENTS.md`, `llms.txt` (Soft guidance) | 🟢 ACTIVE |

## 2. The 8-Verse Mantra (Port Architecture)

Every component must align with the 8 Legendary Commanders and their respective Ports.

```gherkin
☷ Port 0 - LIDLESS LEGION:   Given One Swarm to Rule the Eight (SENSE)
☶ Port 1 - WEB WEAVER:       And Branches Growing from the Gate (FUSE)
☵ Port 2 - MIRROR MAGUS:     And Spawns Evolve to Recreate (SHAPE)
☴ Port 3 - SPORE STORM:      When Ignitions Flow to Pulsate (DELIVER)
☳ Port 4 - RED REGNANT:      And Deadly Venoms Concentrate (TEST)
☲ Port 5 - PYRE PRAETORIAN:  And Instincts Rise to Isolate (DEFEND)
☱ Port 6 - KRAKEN KEEPER:    Then Artifacts Accumulate (STORE)
☰ Port 7 - SPIDER SOVEREIGN: And Navigate the Higher State (DECIDE)
```

## 3. Anti-Theater & Anti-Slop Rules

1. **NO THEATER**: Do not report "Green" without "Red". Every implementation in `silver/` must have a corresponding test in the same directory.
2. **RED PROOF**: A test that passes on the first try is a LIE. It must fail first.
3. **NO HOLLOW SHELLS**: Use of `pass`, `...`, or empty bodies in public exports is a violation.
4. **VACUOLE ENVELOPE**: All public exports must be wrapped in a `VacuoleEnvelope` (Zod-validated) to ensure data integrity.
5. **MUTATION KILL**: No code moves to Silver without a >80% mutation score (Stryker).

---

## 4. Medallion Flow

1. **BRONZE**: Slop, Kinetic Energy, Experiments. No rules except "don't break the root."
2. **SILVER**: Verified Implementations. Must pass TDD, Mutation Testing, and Screamer checks.
3. **GOLD**: Canonical Manifests & Truth Sources. Only human-approved or high-confidence AI artifacts.

## 5. The Fractal Growth Rule (Powers of 2 → 8)

All quantities MUST be powers of 2. Powers of 2 fractally build toward powers of 8 in production.

| Bootstrap | Minimal | Production | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | 2 | 8 | Single → Pair → Octet |
| 2 | 4 | 8 | Pair → Quad → Octet |
| 4 | 8 | 64 | Quad → Octet → 8² |

## 6. Knowledge Bank (DuckDB FTS)

The system is grounded in a **DuckDB Knowledge Bank** containing 6,423+ artifacts from previous generations (Pre-HFO to Gen 84).

- **Location**: `cold_obsidian_sandbox/silver/active_root/portable_hfo_memory_pre_hfo_to_gen84_2025-12-27T21-46-52/hfo_memory.duckdb`
- **Usage**: AI agents MUST query this database before reinventing architectures. "Did I check the Knowledge Bank?" is a mandatory pre-flight check.

---

## 7. Stigmergy (Blackboard)

All progress and violations MUST be logged to `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` in the root. This is the central nervous system of the swarm.
