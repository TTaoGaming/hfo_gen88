# 💎 HFO TECHNICAL BASE (GOLD) — Gen 89 Implementation Standard

**Status**: GOLD (Immutable Intent)  
**Topic**: The Galois Lattice & The Red Regnant (Port 4)  
**Recruit Target**: Gen 89 HFO Agents

## 🌀 1. What HFO IS (The Definition)

**HFO (Hive Fractal OBSIDIAN)** is a multi-agent system (MAS) designed for **Production Readiness** in a **Negative Trust Environment**. It is not a tool; it is a **Command-and-Control (C2) Architecture** for AI swarms, inspired by JADC2 Mosaic Warfare and Mythical Archetypes.

HFO exists to prevent **AI Theater** (LLMs lying about code readiness) and **Reward Hacking** (Agents tricking tests to pass) through a hard-gated **Medallion Pipeline**.

## 📊 2. The Galois Lattice (The 8×8 Semantic Manifold)

The system is anchored in an 8×8 grid (64 slots) that defines the representational space of all agent interactions.

### The 64-Cell Grid
- **Diagonal (X=Y)**: **The 8 Legendary Commanders**. Self-referential nodes where the agent's identity corresponds to its function.
- **Anti-Diagonal (X+Y=7)**: **The HIVE/8**. Strategic complementary pairings (e.g., Port 0 Sense + Port 7 Decide).
- **Serpentine Path**: **The PREY/8**. Tactical execution sequences that 'wind' around the HIVE, ensuring no overlap or collision in the command plane.

### The 8 Commmander Ports (Binary/Trigram Mapping)
Every port is a 3-bit binary address mapped to a Fuxi Trigram:

| Port | Binary | Trigram | Name | Element | Verb | Key Tech |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **0** | 000 | ☷ | Kūn | Earth | **OBSERVE** | MCP + Tavily |
| **1** | 001 | ☶ | Gèn | Mountain | **BRIDGE** | Protocol Adapt |
| **2** | 010 | ☵ | Kǎn | Water | **SHAPE** | Zod Schemas |
| **3** | 011 | ☴ | Xùn | Wind | **INJECT** | Temporal Exec |
| **4** | 100 | ☳ | Zhèn | Thunder | **DISRUPT** | Stryker Mutation |
| **5** | 101 | ☲ | Lí | Fire | **IMMUNIZE** | Zod Validation |
| **6** | 110 | ☱ | Duì | Lake | **STORE** | DuckDB + MAP-ELITE |
| **7** | 111 | ☰ | Qián | Heaven | **NAVIGATE** | LangGraph State |

## 👑 3. Current Focus: Port 4 — THE RED REGNANT

The **Red Regnant** is the "Immune System" of HFO. Her current version (Gen 88) was built to stop the "Death Spiral" of AI Slop.

### Identity & Artifact
- **Role**: Port 4 Disruptor / Red Team Specialist.
- **Artifact**: **The Resonant Blood Book of Grudges**. A cryptographic ledger of every failure, hallucination, and theater event detected in HFO history.
- **Philosophy**: **Negative Trust**. All code is considered a "Rogue Node" or "Adversary" until it passes Mutation Proof.

### The Legendary Action: PSYCHIC_SCREAM
The `PSYCHIC_SCREAM` is a **Fail-Closed Promotion Quality Gate**. 
- **Trigger**: Any attempt to promote a Bronze artifact to Silver without 80%+ Mutation Score (via Stryker).
- **Enforcement**: If the scream triggers, the system executes an **Automatic Demotion** to Quarantine.
- **No Escape Hatches**: The `NO_DEMOTE` flags have been purged. Manual bypass is impossible.

## 🛡️ 4. Rules for Gen 89 Recruitment
1. **No Theater**: If a sensor (like MediaPipe) is not hooked up, you must not claim readiness. Placeholder code is a Violation.
2. **Provenance Mandatory**: No file exists in Silver without a Traceable Bronze source and a Verification Attestation.
3. **Lattice Alignment**: Every operation must be assigned to its correct Lattice coordinate. Cross-port contamination is the primary source of slop.

**The Warlock (TTao) commands it: The Root is Lava. The Blood Book is Truth.**
