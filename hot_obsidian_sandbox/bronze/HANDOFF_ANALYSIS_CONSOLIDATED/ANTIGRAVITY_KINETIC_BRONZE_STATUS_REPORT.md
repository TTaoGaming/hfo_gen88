# 🛸 ANTIGRAVITY KINETIC — BRONZE STATUS REPORT [2026-01-05T19:25:14-07:00]

## 🎯 Executive Oversight: THE CANALIZATION OF GEN 88

This report provides a forensic snapshot of the **HFO Gen 88** system within the **Bronze Hot Sandbox**. The system is currently in a state of high-energy "Kinetic" development, with a rigorous focus on "Canalization"—enforcing structural correctness through extreme immunity gates.

## 📊 SYSTEM STATUS: Medallion Layering

| Layer      | Status         | Description                                                                                              |
| :--------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GOLD**   | ⚪ **DORMANT** | Zero canonized artifacts. The "Hallowed Ground" remains empty until absolute coherence is achieved.      |
| **SILVER** | 🟡 **MINIMAL** | Only `P4_RED_REGNANT/psychic_scream.ts` is active. This is the "Immune System" baseline.                 |
| **BRONZE** | 🟢 **ACTIVE**  | Full kinetic energy. Contains all experimental code, contracts, and the "Heavy Quarantine" holding area. |

### 🛑 Current Blockers

- **Heavy Quarantine**: 8 functional ports (Commanders) are implemented but held in quarantine awaiting promotion gate validation.
- **Promotion Friction**: The "Psychic Scream" gate requires 80-99% mutation kill rates and strict VacuoleEnvelope compliance, which most Bronze artifacts currently fail.

## 🧬 CAPABILITIES: What We Can and Cannot Do

### ✅ Functional Capabilities (KINETICAL)

1. **ISR & Observation (P0)**: Perform deep telemetry and search (Lidless Legion).
2. **Gesture Monolith**: Real-time webcam tracking → OneEuro Filtering → Rapier2D Physics smoothing → W3C Pointer Event emission.
3. **Contract Law (L6)**: Strict Zod-based schemas for all inter-port communication (Verbs, Ports, Envelopes).
4. **Immune Enforcement (L2)**: Automated detection of root pollution, missing tests, and untyped variables (Psychic Scream).
5. **Semantic Grounding**: 8x8 Galois Lattice mapping for 64-cell decision calculus.

### ❌ Current Limitations (RESTRICTED)

1. **Multi-Hand Tracking**: The gesture pipeline is currently limited to a single hand and wrist.
2. **Gold Promotion**: Absolute zero artifacts have reached Gold status.
3. **Database Integration**: P6 (Kraken Keeper) is restricted by DuckDB dependency complexities during mutation testing.
4. **Autonomous Decisioning**: P7 (Spider Sovereign) workflows are drafted but not yet executed in a durable environment.

## ⚡ MUTATION ANALYSIS: State & Side-Effects

### 🔥 COMPONENT TYPE: MUTATION (Stateful / Disruptive)

_These components change the system state, modify data, or inject chaos._

- **P3_SPORE_STORM (INJECT)**: Cascading delivery and payload injection.
- **P4_RED_REGNANT (DISRUPT)**: Chaos injection, mutation testing, and the "Psychic Scream" logging.
- **P6_KRAKEN_KEEPER (ASSIMILATE)**: Write operations to DuckDB storage (Assimilation into memory).
- **P7_SPIDER_SOVEREIGN (NAVIGATE)**: Running durable workflows and updating lattice tension.
- **gesture-pipeline.ts**: Internal state mutation for filtering and physics stepping.

### ❄️ COMPONENT TYPE: NON-MUTATION (Read-Only / Structural)

_These components specialize in analysis, transformation, or constraint definition._

- **P0_LIDLESS_LEGION (OBSERVE)**: "Eyes Only" ISR. Senses without altering.
- **P2_MIRROR_MAGUS (SHAPE)**: Pure functional transformations of manifests and payloads.
- **Bronze/Contracts/**: Static Zod schemas and type definitions.
- **STATE_OF_THE_SYSTEM_GEN88.md**: Metadata and forensic analysis reports.
- **P1_WEB_WEAVER (BRIDGE)**: Conduit for data wrapping (FUSE) without persistent mutation.

## 📋 COMMANDER READINESS MATRIX

| Port | Commander        | Status         | Mission             |
| :--: | :--------------- | :------------- | :------------------ |
|  0   | Lidless Legion   | **QUARANTINE** | SENSE (ISR)         |
|  1   | Web Weaver       | **QUARANTINE** | FUSE (Transport)    |
|  2   | Mirror Magus     | **ACTIVE (B)** | SHAPE (Fires)       |
|  3   | Spore Storm      | **QUARANTINE** | DELIVER (Logistics) |
|  4   | Red Regnant      | **SILVER (1)** | TEST (Red Cell)     |
|  5   | Pyre Praetorian  | **QUARANTINE** | DEFEND (Protection) |
|  6   | Kraken Keeper    | **QUARANTINE** | STORE (PED)         |
|  7   | Spider Sovereign | **QUARANTINE** | DECIDE (C2)         |

## 🔮 RECOMMENDATION

Focus on the **"V" (Validate)** phase of the HIVE/8 workflow: **Mirror Magus (P2)** shapes what **Pyre Praetorian (P5)** immunizes. Bridging these two will allow the first significant cluster of Bronze artifacts to pass the Silver gate.
