# 🦅 HFO Gen 88: Bronze Status Report [OBSIDIAN_VANGUARD // CANAL_SURFER]

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-05T19:25:01-07:00  
**Status**: ACTIVE CANALIZATION (Gen 88)  
**Security Level**: BRONZE (Kinetic/Experimental)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The system is currently operating under the **Gen 88 Canalization Architecture**. The primary objective is to enforce architectural correctness through structural "canals" (gates) rather than agent trust. Most system components are currently resident in **Bronze** or **Quarantine**, with only the core immune system (`P4_RED_REGNANT/psychic_scream.ts`) promoted to **Silver**.

## 🛠️ System Capabilities (What We CAN Do)

| Capability               | Port | Description                                                          |
| :----------------------- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Sensing**       | P0   | Gather telemetry and landmarks via Lidless Legion.                   |
| **Data Fusion**          | P1   | Wrap and bridge data using `VacuoleEnvelope` (Zod validation).       |
| **Polymorphic Shaping**  | P2   | Transform and adapt code artifacts for specific targets.             |
| **Cascading Injection**  | P3   | Execute deliveries and triggers across the swarm.                    |
| **Chaos Gating**         | P4   | Perform mutation testing (Stryker) and disrupt "Theater" compliance. |
| **Defensive Hardening**  | P5   | Isolate and protect components via Pyre Praetorian protocols.        |
| **Persistent Memory**    | P6   | Store and query artifacts using the DuckDB Knowledge Bank.           |
| **Strategic Navigation** | P7   | Decide mission-fit and strategic direction via Spider Sovereign.     |

## 🚧 System Limitations (What We CANNOT Do)

- **Bypass the Scream**: Cannot promote code to Silver that fails the `psychic_scream.ts` audit (0 pollution, no untyped `any`).
- **Theater Compliance**: Cannot report "Green" (passing tests) without "Red" (failing tests history/proof).
- **Mutation Gate**: Cannot cross the Silver threshold with a mutation kill rate below **80%**.
- **Root Pollution**: Cannot add files to the root directory without triggering immediate quarantine.
- **Untrusted Exports**: Cannot export public functions/data without `VacuoleEnvelope` wrapping.

## 🧬 Mutation Analysis

### High Mutation (Kinetic Zone)

- **Bronze Layer**: All files in the Bronze layer are subject to high mutation. This is the "experimental" zone where slop and kinetic energy reside.
- **P4 (Red Regnant)**: Actively generates mutations (via Stryker) to test the robustness of the test suites.
- **P3 (Spore Storm)**: Handles the "Evolve" phase of the HIVE/8 workflow, injecting dynamic changes into the system.

### Low/No Mutation (Stability Zone)

- **Silver Layer**: Verified implementations. Mutation is minimized here; changes require re-validation through the full quality gate.
- **Gold Layer (IMMUTABLE)**: Canonical manifests and truth sources. Designed for ZERO mutation once canonized.
- **P6 (Kraken Keeper)**: Focused on archival integrity and "cold" memory storage.
