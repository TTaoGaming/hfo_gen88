# 🦅 BRONZE STATUS REPORT — [BRONZE_STASIS | HYPER_FRACTAL]

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-05T19:25:05-07:00  
**Status**: READ-ONLY AUDIT (Bronze Boundary)  
**Keywords**: `BRONZE_STASIS`, `HYPER_FRACTAL`

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The HFO Gen 88 system is currently in a state of **Canalization Stasis**. All primary development and "kinetic energy" are constrained to the **Bronze Sandbox**. The transition to Silver and Gold is strictly gated by the **Promotion Engine** and the **Psychic Scream** immune system. This report details the functional capabilities and mutation patterns observed across the 8-port architecture.

## 📊 Medallion Status Matrix

| Layer          | Status     | Description                                           |
| :------------- | :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gold**       | ⚪ EMPTY   | No artifacts have reached canonical status.           |
| **Silver**     | 🟡 MINIMAL | Only `P4_RED_REGNANT/psychic_scream.ts` is promoted.  |
| **Bronze**     | 🟢 ACTIVE  | Core development, experiments, and kinetic workflows. |
| **Quarantine** | 🔴 HEAVY   | All 8 Commander implementations pending promotion.    |

## 🕸️ Port Authority: Mutation vs. Stasis

The system follows an 8-port architecture (Ports 0-7). Below is the audit of which ports possess **Mutation** (state-changing) capabilities versus those in **Stasis** (read/transform only).

| Port   | Commander        | Verb       | Mutation? | Description                                             |
| :----- | :--------------- | :--------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **P0** | Lidless Legion   | OBSERVE    | **NO**    | ISR, Sensor Fusion (Camera, Thermal). Pure perception.  |
| **P1** | Web Weaver       | BRIDGE     | **NO**    | Data FUSE, wrapping in `VacuoleEnvelope`. Connectivity. |
| **P2** | Mirror Magus     | SHAPE      | **NO**    | Translation, filtering (One Euro/Kalman). Data shaping. |
| **P3** | Spore Storm      | INJECT     | **YES**   | Delivery, payload injection, W3C event emission.        |
| **P4** | Red Regnant      | DISRUPT    | **YES**   | Chaos injection, mutation testing, promotion gating.    |
| **P5** | Pyre Praetorian  | IMMUNIZE   | **YES**   | Defensive hardening, security state management.         |
| **P6** | Kraken Keeper    | ASSIMILATE | **YES**   | Storage (DuckDB/LanceDB), record/append to ledgers.     |
| **P7** | Spider Sovereign | NAVIGATE   | **YES**   | Strategic decisions, workflow orchestration (Temporal). |

## 🧩 Current System Capabilities (What We CAN Do)

- **Kinetic Prototyping**: Rapid iteration in Bronze without polluting Silver/Gold.
- **Sensor Perception (P0)**: MediaPipe hand/pose tracking and ISR gathering.
- **Mutation Testing (P4)**: Vitest and Stryker-based "screaming" to enforce quality.
- **Ledger Minting**: Creating and updating `*_LEDGER.md` files for provenance tracking.
- **Contract Enforcement**: Zod-based validation via `contracts/` schemas.
- **FCA Analysis**: Utilizing the 8x8 Galois Lattice for semantic mapping of agent tasks.

---

## 🚧 System Limitations (What We CANNOT Do)

- **Live Silver/Gold Execution**: Until `contracts/envelope.ts` and other core dependencies pass the gate, Silver remains functionally isolated.
- **Bypass Quality Gates**: The "Psychic Scream" prevents any code without high mutation coverage (80-99%) or proper provenance from being promoted.
- **Unstructured State**: Any mutation outside of the Ledger/Blood Book system is considered "Theater" and is subject to disruption by P4.
- **Cross-Port Violation**: No commander can execute another's verb without proper interlock (I-Phase).

---

## 🔮 Forensic Keywords

- **`BRONZE_STASIS`**: Represents the current phase where the majority of the system's intelligence is built but held in high-fidelity stasis within the Bronze layer.
- **`HYPER_FRACTAL`**: Denotes the recursive nature of the system (e.g., the 6x6/8x8 lattice) where every action reflects the architecture of the whole.
