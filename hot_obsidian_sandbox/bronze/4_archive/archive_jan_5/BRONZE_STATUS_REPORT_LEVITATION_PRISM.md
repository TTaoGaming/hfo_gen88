## 🛰️ System Summary (HFO Gen 88)

The system is currently in the **Canalization Phase** of Gen 88. The architecture is designed to enforce correctness through structural constraints (Medallion Flow). While the **Bronze** layer is highly active with experimental energy and kinetic components, the transition to **Silver** and **Gold** is strictly gated by the "Psychic Scream" immune system.

### Medallion Tier Distribution

| Layer          | Health     | Content Status                                                  |
| :------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gold**       | ⚪ Dormant | No canonized artifacts.                                         |
| **Silver**     | 🟡 Minimal | Only `psychic_scream.ts` is promoted.                           |
| **Bronze**     | 🟢 High    | Core kinetic logic, active experiments, all 8 ports present.    |
| **Quarantine** | 🔴 Heavy   | Many artifacts pending promotion due to mutation gate failures. |

## 🛠️ Capability Matrix (Can vs. Cannot)

### ✅ What We CAN Do

- **Contract Enforcement**: Define and validate system interactions using **Zod** schemas in `bronze/contracts`.
- **Gesture Pipeline**: Process webcam/Mediapipe input through **Rapier2D** physics and a Finite State Machine (FSM) via `gesture-pipeline.ts`.
- **Automated Verification**: Run **Vitest** for units and **Stryker** for mutation testing via the promotion engine.
- **Forensic Auditing**: Monitor system health and AI behavior via the `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` (21MB log).
- **Provenance Tracking**: Maintain historical ledgers (Blood & Shield Books) to ensure data integrity and SHA-256 chain validation.
- **Immune Response**: Execute `psychic_scream.ts` to detect root pollution, untyped `any`, and missing tests.

### ❌ What We CANNOT Do (Yet)

- **Automated Evolution**: Most Commanders (P0-P7) remain in **Quarantine**, limiting full HIVE/8 strategic execution.
- **Zero-Hallucination Operations**: The system still records "Theater" incidents where compliance is cosmetic rather than functional.
- **Seamless Web UI**: Gesture output is currently logic-heavy; native browser integration for the pointer is pending Silver promotion.
- **Gold-Level Stability**: The system lacks any "Gold" standard artifacts, meaning no mission-critical code is yet considered "immutable truth."

## 🧬 Mutation Audit

### ⚡ Stateful / Mutation Operations (WRITE)

- **Promotion Engine**: Moves files between Medallion layers (Bronze → Silver).
- **Ledger Minting**: scripts like `mint_blood_book.ts` change the chain state.
- **Physics Simulation**: `gesture-pipeline.ts` mutates internal Rapier2D world state during processing.
- **Blackboard Logging**: Any system action appends to `obsidianblackboard.jsonl`.
- **Infill/Ingestion**: Scripts that populate DuckDB (Kraken Keeper) or generate new grudge records.

### 🧊 Stateless / Pure Operations (READ-ONLY)

- **Zod Contracts**: pure schema definitions for validation.
- **Screamer Audit**: `psychic_scream.ts` (when performing verification scans).
- **FCA Lattice Mapping**: Semantic resolution of Commander roles (8x8 manifold).
- **Observation (ISR)**: Port 0 (Lidless Legion) gathering telemetry without altering files.
- **State of System**: Markdown reports and documentation reflecting current truth.

## 🔍 Forensic Pulse (Recent Findings)

The most recent entries in the `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` (as of 21:18Z) indicate:

1.  **Root Pollution Detected**: `psychic_scream.ts` is blocking promotions due to non-compliant file structures in `contracts`.
2.  **Manifest Violations**: Red Regnant (P4) is missing critical metadata, triggering a "SCREAM" violation.
3.  **High Entropy**: The Quarantine directory is swelling, suggesting that many current implementations are failing the **80-99% Mutation Kill Rate** requirement.
