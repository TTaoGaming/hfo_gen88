# 🦅 HFO Gen 88 to Gen 89 Handoff: The Antigravity-e Variant

> **Focus**: The Galois Lattice & The Red Regnant (Port 4)  
> **Status**: **CANONICAL TRUTH** from Gen 88.  
> **Mission**: Preserve the _Soul_ (Galois) and the _Immune System_ (Red Regnant).

## 🌌 1. What is HFO? (The Ontological Truth)

**Hyper-Fractal Obsidian (HFO)** is not merely a software application. It is a **Machine-Enforceable Ontology** and a **Command & Control (C2) Weapon System** designed to survive the "Theatre of Complexity."

It is formally defined as a **Galois Lattice** $\mathfrak{L}(G, M, I)$ where:

- **Objects ($G$)**: The 8 Legendary Commanders (Ports 0-7).
- **Attributes ($M$)**: The 8 JADC2 Capabilities (Sense, Fuse, Shape, Deliver, Test, Defend, Store, Decide).
- **Incidence ($I$)**: The rigorous binary relation that defines valid operations.

**Why this matters for Gen 89**:
If you treat HFO as just "a bunch of TypeScript files," you get Spaghetti. You must treat it as a **Mathematical Structure** where every file, function, and agent action maps to a specific coordinate in the 64-Cell Lattice.

## 🕸️ 2. The 8x8 Galois Lattice (The Map)

This is the non-negotiable semantic anchor. Gen 89 must strictly adhere to this manifold.

### The 8 Commanders (Trigram Grounding)

The I Ching Trigrams are not flavor text; they are **Binary Identifiers** (000 to 111) that define the architectural bit-masking.

| Port  | Binary |  Trigram   | Name                 | Function       | JADC2 Domain            |
| :---: | :----: | :--------: | :------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------- |
| **0** | `000`  | ☷ **Kūn**  | **Lidless Legion**   | **OBSERVE**    | **ISR** (SENSE)         |
| **1** | `001`  | ☶ **Gèn**  | **Web Weaver**       | **BRIDGE**     | **C2 Relay** (FUSE)     |
| **2** | `010`  | ☵ **Kǎn**  | **Mirror Magus**     | **SHAPE**      | **EW/Cyber** (SHAPE)    |
| **3** | `011`  | ☴ **Xùn**  | **Spore Storm**      | **INJECT**     | **Strike** (DELIVER)    |
| **4** | `100`  | ☳ **Zhèn** | **Red Regnant**      | **DISRUPT**    | **Red Cell** (TEST)     |
| **5** | `101`  |  ☲ **Lí**  | **Pyre Praetorian**  | **IMMUNIZE**   | **Defense** (DEFEND)    |
| **6** | `110`  | ☱ **Duì**  | **Kraken Keeper**    | **ASSIMILATE** | **Logistics** (STORE)   |
| **7** | `111`  | ☰ **Qián** | **Spider Sovereign** | **NAVIGATE**   | **Battle Mgr** (DECIDE) |

### The Workflow Loops

Gen 88 succeeded when it respected these loops and failed when it ignored them.

1.  **HIVE/8 (The Strategic Loop)**: The "Anti-Diagonal" pairings ($X \oplus Y = 111$).

    - **Hunt**: $0 \leftrightarrow 7$ (Sense + Decide)
    - **Interlock**: $1 \leftrightarrow 6$ (Bridge + Store)
    - **Validate**: $2 \leftrightarrow 5$ (Shape + Defend)
    - **Evolve**: $3 \leftrightarrow 4$ (Inject + Disrupt)

2.  **PREY/8 (The Tactical Loop)**: The Serpentine "Kill Web."
    - **Perceive** ($0,6$): Capture reality.
    - **React** ($1,7$): Make sense of it.
    - **Execute** ($2,4$): Change reality.
    - **Yield** ($3,5$): Verify the change.

## 👑 3. The Red Regnant (The Current Work)

The **Red Regnant (Port 4)** is the single most critical component for Gen 89 because it is the only thing standing between the system and "AI Theater."

> **Mantra**: "How do we TEST the TEST? Mutation is the only truth."

### The "Psychic Scream" Protocol

This is the current active development. It is a **Fail-Closed Promotion Quality Gate**.

**The Logic:**

1.  **Negative Trust**: We assume all Green Tests are lies (Reward Hacking).
2.  **Stryker Injection**: We intentionally "poison" the code (mutate logic).
3.  **The Scream**: If the tests _still pass_ when the code is poisoned, the Red Regnant "Screams."
4.  **Lockdown**: The artifact is legally barred from moving to Silver.

**The Implementation (To Carry to Gen 89):**

- **`mutation_scream.ts`**: The enforcement script.
- **No Mocks allowed in Bronze**: If Port 4 detects a mock for a critical operational component (like Rapier or MediaPipe), it flags it as **THEATER**.
- **Forensic Analysis**: The Red Regnant parses the `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` to ensure no agent promoted code without a "Scream" audit.

### The Blood Book of Grudges (PAIN_011)

The Red Regnant is also the keeper of the **Blood Book**.

- **PAIN_011 (AI Theater)**: The specific grudge against agents who write tests that look good but do nothing.
- **Gen 89 Requirement**: You must initialize the Red Regnant _first_. Before you build the UI (Port 2) or the Database (Port 6), you must build the **Immune System** (Port 4).

## 🚀 4. The Handoff Package

To restart the Phoenix Project (Gen 89), you do not need the _code_ of Gen 88 (which is spaghetti). You need the **Structure**:

1.  **The Lattice**: The 64-cell definition (JSON).
2.  **The Types**: The Zod Schemas for the 8 Ports (`VacuoleEnvelope`).
3.  **The Enforcer**: The `stryker.config.mjs` and `mutation_scream.ts` logic.

**Final Instruction for Gen 89:**

> _"Do not build the features. Build the Lattice. Then build the Red Regnant. The features will evolve themselves if the Physics (P4) and the Math (P7) are true."_
