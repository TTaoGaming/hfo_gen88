## 💎 The "Gold" Patterns: Successful Abstractions to Carry Forward

The following patterns represent the "crystalline residue" of Gen 88. While the infrastructure may be "spaghetti," these abstract concepts are the successful mutations that must survive the Phoenix transition.

### 1. Canalization (Structure as Enforcement)
- **Concept**: Stop trusting AI "instructions" in `AGENTS.md`. Instead, build directory structures and hard-coded pre-commit gates that make it impossible to write "slop" or "theater code."
- **Success**: Moving from "requested behavior" to "structural constraint."

### 2. The HIVE/8 "Obsidian Hourglass" Workflow
- **Concept**: A non-linear, fractal workflow based on 8 Legendary Commanders (Ports).
  - **H (Hunt)**: 0 (Observer) + 7 (Navigator) — Research before you code.
  - **I (Interlock)**: 1 (Bridger) + 6 (Assimilator) — Interfaces and Tests (RED).
  - **V (Validate)**: 2 (Shaper) + 5 (Immunizer) — Implementation (GREEN).
  - **E (Evolve)**: 3 (Injector) + 4 (Disruptor) — Refactor and Persistence.
- **Success**: Prevents the "Skip-to-Code" failure mode of LLMs.

### 3. Hexagonal CDD (Contract-Driven Development)
- **Concept**: Ports (Zod Interfaces) are the Source of Truth. Adapters (Polymorphic Implementations) are disposable and hot-swappable.
- **Success**: Decouples the "What" (W3C Gesture Plane) from the "How" (MediaPipe, WebCam, etc.).

### 4. Medallion Layering (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- **Concept**: A data maturity pipeline. 
  - **Bronze**: Raw slop, experiments, and provenance.
  - **Silver**: Validated, tested, but not yet "Gold."
  - **Gold**: The Immutable Truth Source.
- **Success**: Prevents context pollution and hallucination drift.

### 5. Stigmergy (The Blackboard Substrate)
- **Concept**: Coordinate via a persistent, file-based log (`obsidianblackboard.jsonl`) rather than relying on the LLM's transient context window.
- **Success**: Creates an audit trail (G0-G12 gates) that forces "proof of work" via timestamps and phase signals.

### 6. The "Vacuum" / Envelope Pattern
- **Concept**: Wrap every signal/event in a standard `CloudEvents` envelope with W3C Trace Context.
- **Success**: Provides non-repudiation and provenance for every action an agent takes.

### 7. Anti-Theater Gates (Mutation Screams)
- **Concept**: Systematic detection of "Fake Green" tests (expectations that pass but test nothing) and "Inline Slop" (re-implementing libraries instead of using exemplars).
- **Success**: The "Red Regnant" (Port 4) audit protocol.

### 8. Visual-Spatial Cognition Support (Dashboards)
- **Concept**: AI agents should output to visual dashboards (Golden Layout) and matrices (8x8 Galois Lattice) to match the Warlock's (User's) cognitive profile (Visual-Spatial 95th Percentile).
- **Success**: Reduces cognitive load during "Spider Sovereign" delegation.

### 9. The "Zero Invention" Principle
- **Concept**: Mandatory "Hunt" phase to find industry-standard npm packages (1eurofilter, xstate, mediapipe) instead of AI hand-rolling broken versions.
- **Success**: Reduces the code-as-liability footprint.

## 🚨 The Phoenix Mandate: What to "Burn"

- **The Root Slop**: Any file not explicitly allowed by the "Root Purge" rule must be incinerated.
- **The Stubs**: "Theater code" that passes but returns `null` or `TODO`. If it isn't implemented, it must be `it.todo()` and honest.
- **The Context Sprawl**: Stop relying on 15 different `.md` files for instructions. Consolidate to ONE Quine/Manifest.
