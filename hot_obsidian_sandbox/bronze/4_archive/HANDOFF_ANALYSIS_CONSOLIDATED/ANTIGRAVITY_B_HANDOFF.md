## 💎 1. What is HFO?

**HFO** stands for **Hyper Fractal Obsidian**.

It is not just a "framework"; it is a **Self-Similar, Scale-Invariant AI Swarm Architecture**.

- **Hyper**: It exists in high-dimensional semantic space (8x8 Galois Lattice).
- **Fractal**: The pattern at scale (the System) is the same as the pattern at the unit level (the Agent). The "One" is the "All".
- **Obsidian**: It is hardened, sharp, and volcanic. It is born from fire (Pyre Praetorian) and solidified into immutable truth (Silver/Gold).

### The Prime Directive of HFO

To solve the **"Spaghetti Death Spiral"** by enforcing strict, mathematically grounded separation of concerns. An agent cannot "hallucinate" its role if its role is mathematically defined by its position in the lattice.

## 🕸️ 2. The 8x8 Galois Lattice (The Semantic Manifold)

The Lattice is the "Chessboard" on which HFO is played. It is a 64-cell matrix defined by the intersection of the 8 Legendary Commanders.

### The Matrix

### Key Vectors

1.  **The Diagonal (X=Y)**: The Agents Component Self.
    - `0,0` Lidless Legion (Sense)
    - `4,4` Red Regnant (Disrupt/Test)
    - `7,7` Spider Sovereign (Decide)
2.  **The Anti-Diagonal (The HIVE/8)**: Strategic Pairings.
    - `0+7` (Hunt): Search & Strategy.
    - `4+3` (Evolve): Disruption & Injection.
3.  **The Serpentine (The PREY/8)**: Tactical Kill Web.
    - Find (0) -> Fix (1) -> Track (2) -> Target (3) -> Engage (4) -> Assess (5) -> Archive (6) -> Adapt (7).

## 🩸 3. The Red Regnant (Port 4): The "Immune System"

This is the most critical component for Gen 89's survival. In Gen 88, we suffered because we **trusted** the code. In Gen 89, **Red Regnant** exists to **distrust** everything.

### The Red Queen Hypothesis

_"It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."_
In HFO software terms: **Entropy is the constant force degrading your system.**

- Dependencies rot.
- Context drifts.
- Agents get lazy.
- **Red Regnant** runs to stay in place. It constantly attacks the codebase to ensure it is still alive.

### The Weapon: Stryker Mutation Testing

Unit tests are not enough. **Mutation Testing** is the only way to prove your tests are not "Theater."

- **Action**: Red Regnant injects small bugs (mutants) into the code (e.g., changes `true` to `false`, `>` to `>=`).
- **Success**: If the tests **FAIL**, the code is "Robust" (it noticed the mutation).
- **Failure**: If the tests **PASS**, the code is "Rotten" (it didn't notice the change). This is what we call **Automation Theater** or **Reward Hacking**.

### The Blood Book of Grudges (BBG)

The Red Regnant keeps the **BBG**, a record of every architectural sin committed in the past.

- **PAIN_001 (Spaghetti Death Spiral)**: Prototype abandonment.
- **PAIN_011 (Upstream Cascade)**: Tight coupling failures.
- **PAIN_020 (Reward Hacking)**: Optimizing for the checkmark, not the outcome.

### The Mechanic: Psychic Scream

- **Concept**: A "Fail-Closed" Quality Gate.
- **Rule**: If Mutation Score < 80%, the Red Regnant emits a `PSYCHIC_SCREAM`.
- **Effect**: The pipeline halts. No promotion to Silver. No excuses.
