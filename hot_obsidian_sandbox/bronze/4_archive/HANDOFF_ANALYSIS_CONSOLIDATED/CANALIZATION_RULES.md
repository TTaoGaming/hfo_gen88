# 🚧 CANALIZATION RULES (Gen 89)

These are environmental constraints. They are not suggestions.

1. **The Root is Lava**: Any file or folder not listed in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) must be auto-deleted.
2. **Medallion Gatekeeping**:
   - **Bronze**: Kinetic/Disposable.
   - **Silver**: Verified/Tested (Traceable).
   - **Gold**: Immutable/Canonical.
3. **Blackboard Stigmergy**: All agent decisions must produce a JSONL signal on [obsidianblackboard.jsonl](obsidianblackboard.jsonl).
4. **Triple Grounding**: Failure to use Tavily, Thinking, or Memory is a protocol breach.
5. **No Theater**: If a dependency is missing, fail loud. Do not polyfill with lies.
