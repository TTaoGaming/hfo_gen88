## 📄 PAGE 1: Executive Overview & The "Baton"
### The Mission: Total Tool Virtualization (TTV)
The HFO project is transitioning from Gen 88 (Canalization) to a state of **Indestructible Intent**. The "Discipline Gap" identified by the Warlock (TTao)—where aspiration (85th percentile) meets behavior (40th percentile)—is being bridged not by willpower, but by **Infrastructure Sovereignty**.

### Current Status: The Hexagonal Pivot
We are moving away from "Theater Code" (fragile mocks, unused NATS logs, unimplemented tests) toward a **Vertical Spike** that connects a real Camera feed to a real W3C Pointer Event via a Durable Execution kernel.

### The Baton (Handoff Summary)
- **Infrastructure**: Temporal/LangGraph is the new state-management standard.
- **Product**: W3C Gesture Control is the primary income-generating priority.
- **Enforcement**: Red Regnant is active. root pollution is being purged.
- **Coordination**: This document serves as the "Sequence of Truth" to fix the gaps between previous agent sessions (e.g., Kiro v1.4 vs Gemini v1.5).

## 📄 PAGE 2: Infrastructure Sovereignty (Durable Execution)
*Grounding: Tavily Search + Context7 (Temporal/NATS)*

### 1. Temporal: The Indestructible Intent
Temporal provides the **Durable Execution** backbone. Every high-level agent intent (e.g., "Monitor this gesture and dispatch to Excalidraw") is now wrapped in a Temporal Workflow. 
- **Benefit**: Fault-tolerant state machines that survive the "Amnesia" of LLM context windows and server restarts.
- **Status**: TRL 9. Active use of `Checkpointers` to ensure progress is never lost.

### 2. LangGraph: Tactical Reasoning Loops
Where Temporal provides durability, LangGraph provides the **Cyclic Reasoning** capacity for H-I-V-E phases.
- **Nodes**: Represent H, I, V, E steps.
- **Edges**: Zod-validated port boundaries.
- **Pattern**: The "Indestructible Agent" wrap (LangGraph reasoning inside a Temporal Workflow).

### 3. NATS JetStream: Stigmergic Messaging
NATS JetStream (replacing flat JSONL for high-speed kinetic data) handles the "Hot Stigmergy".
- **Patterns**: KV Stores for shared state; Object Store for large MediaPipe landmark caches.
- **Deduplication**: Ensures the swarm doesn't double-process the same gesture pulse.

## 📄 PAGE 3: The 8 Legendary Commanders (Galois Lattice)
*Grounding: Memory Graph (6423 Artifacts)*

The architecture is fixed as an 8-Port Hexagonal System, mapped to the **Galois Lattice**.

| Port | Commander | Verb | JADC2 Role | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | Lidless Legion | SENSE | ISR | MediaPipe / OpenCV |
| **1** | Web Weaver | FUSE | C2 | NATS JetStream |
| **2** | Mirror Magus | SHAPE | Effects | 1€ Filter / Rapier |
| **3** | Spore Storm | DELIVER | Fire | Temporal / LangGraph |
| **4** | Red Regnant | TEST | EW/Cyber | Stryker / Chaos Toolkit |
| **5** | Pyre Praetorian | DEFEND | Defense | Zod / Gate Validation |
| **6** | Kraken Keeper | STORE | Intel | DuckDB / LanceDB |
| **7** | Spider Sovereign | DECIDE | Command | Multi-Agent Orchestrator |

## 📄 PAGE 4: Product Horizon (W3C Gesture Control Plane)
*Grounding: SEARCH_GROUNDING (W3C L4 + MediaPipe WebGPU)*

### W3C Pointer Events Level 4
The vertical slice implements the **W3C Pointer Events L4** spec to ensure "Universal Input."
- **Altitude/Azimuth**: Precise 3D orientation of the palm is mapped to native browser hover/tilt.
- **Persistent Device ID**: Recognizes the specific "Hand" as a persistent device across sessions.
- **Predicted Events**: Uses `getPredictedEvents()` to bridge the gap between camera frame rate and display refresh, ensuring zero-latency "butter" smooth interaction.

### The MediaPipe V4 Pipeline
- **WebGPU Acceleration**: Utilizing the 2025/2026 Hand Landmarker task with WebGPU delegation for **<10ms latency**.
- **Palm Cone Gating**: A strict 30° cone for gesture activation (preventing accidental triggers).
- **Hysteresis**: Schmitt Trigger patterns on all arming gates (enter at 25°, exit at 35°).

## 📄 PAGE 5: V2.1 "Low-Lift" Implementation Plan
### The Simplified Path (Single-File Spike)
To overcome Vite/WASM pathing issues and "Theater Fatigue," we initiate the **V2.1 Low-Lift Plan**:
1. **CDN/ESM Strategy**: Use `https://esm.sh` for MediaPipe, XState, and NATS. Zero local build steps for the initial spike.
2. **Vanilla Sandbox**: A single `vertical_slice_v2_1.html` in `bronze` that demonstrates the full pipeline:
   - Camera -> MediaPipe (CDN) -> 1€ Filter -> XState FSM -> W3C Pointer Emission -> DOM Target.
3. **The "Baton" Logic**: Once the Vanilla Spike is GREEN and verified by the Warlock, we promote the Logic (but not the HTML) to `silver/`.

## 📄 PAGE 6: Defensive Medallion & The Blood Book
### Red Regnant Enforcement (Port 4)
The "Immune System" is now active.
- **Root Purge**: No files allowed in root except the Manifest.
- **Theater Detection**: Automated scripts flag "Mock" implementations that have no tests in `silver/`.
- **Mutation Scream**: Commits fail if mutation score drops below 80% for primary adapters (1€, XState).

### Strategic Stigmergy (The Blackboard)
The `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` is the **Sequence of Truth**.
- **Rule**: If it isn't on the Blackboard, it didn't happen.
- **Grounding Requirement**: All sessions must log **SEARCH**, **THINKING**, and **MEMORY** events (as performed in this v1.5 session).
