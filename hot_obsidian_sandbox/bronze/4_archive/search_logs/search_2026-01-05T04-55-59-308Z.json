        "content": "the SNs' locations are given as input to the clustering algorithm. The Social Spider Optimization Algorithm (SSOA) based Clustering is used to Cluster Head Selection between the nodes which reduces the energy consumption and traffic during the transmission of data from source to destination. The location of the selected Cluster Heads (CHs) is given as input to the SSOA. Additionally, the number of packets from the BS is received which increases by considering the energy in the fitness function. [...] execution and at each stage, the SSA initializes another spider iterative for obtaining solutions. At the initialization Phase, the algorithm consists of an objective function along with the solution is obtained. The SSA parameters have the values proceed further to the initial spider population for the optimization process. During the process of SSA simulations, the total number of spiders is unchanged and the fixed memory size is allocated to store the information. The spiders' positions are [...] performed using the proposed SSOA optimization approach that considers the constraints and leftover total energy after each repetitive iteration of the cycle. The minimum energy is considered to select the CH with high priority. The SSOA algorithm considers the CNs that consist of the highest number of neighbors, which is decided as an optimum to be a CH. An optimal node for CH selection is considered based on the good neighbored clusters, which means a neighbor with a one-hop distance or the",
