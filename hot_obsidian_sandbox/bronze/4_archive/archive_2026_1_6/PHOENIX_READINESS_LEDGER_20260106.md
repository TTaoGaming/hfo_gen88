## 🏛️ 2. Semantic Chunking (Burn vs. Carry)

### 🧺 Group A: THE CRYSTALLINE RESIDUE (Carry to Gen 89)
These are high-TRL patterns that succeeded after 88 generations of evolution.

| Pattern | Boring Name | Port | Why it survived |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Galois Lattice** | `Semantic Registry` | 7 | Prevents architectural drift/hallucination mapping. |
| **Medallion Layers** | `Data Maturity Tiers`| 6 | Prevents experiment "slop" from polluting stable code. |
| **Psychic Scream** | `Mutation Gate` | 4 | Hard-kills "Theater Code" (Tests that don't test). |
| **Vacuole Envelope**| `Message Wrapper` | 1 | Standardized CloudEvents with W3C Trace Context. |
| **1€ Filter** | `Low-Pass Smooth` | 2 | Pure math, no external dependency required. |
| **XState v5** | `Gesture Logic` | 7 | Finite State Machine for reliable intent detection. |

### 🗑️ Group B: THE SLOP (Burn on Entry)
These are failures, theater artifacts, and technical debt that must be incinerated.

| Artifact | Reason for Burning | Port | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `P0_GESTURE_MONOLITH` | **Theater Code**. Mock-dependent, invisible UI. | 0 | 🔥 BURN |
| `Soft Constraints` | AI ignores text rules in `AGENTS.md`. | 5 | 🔥 BURN |
| `Nested Folder Hell` | Import path complexity became intractable. | 6 | 🔥 BURN |
| `Generic LLM Scripts` | Hand-rolled logic instead of using library exemplars. | 1 | 🔥 BURN |

## 🏗️ 3. The Boring HFO (Gen 89 Architecture)
Mapping the mythology to the "Next Gen" functional requirements.

| Commander | Boring Title | Domain | Priority |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Lidless Legion** | `SensorIngest` | Port 0 | Low-latency MediaPipe/Camera stream. |
| **Web Weaver** | `MessageBroker` | Port 1 | NATS/Protocol Adaptation. |
| **Mirror Magus** | `UIRenderer` | Port 2 | Clean, stateful React/GoldenLayout. |
| **Spore Storm** | `Deployer` | Port 3 | Temporal/CI/CD injection. |
| **Red Regnant** | `SecurityAudit` | Port 4 | Mutation testing & root enforcement. |
| **Pyre Praetorian**| `ContractGuard` | Port 5 | Zod validation at every port. |
| **Kraken Keeper** | `Persistence` | Port 6 | DuckDB/VSS Memory storage. |
| **Spider Sovereign**| `Orchestrator` | Port 7 | LangGraph state-action navigation. |

## 🚀 4. "The Phoenix" (Next-Gen Readiness Checklist)

- [x] **Consolidate Signal**: Signal Master v1.0 complete.
- [x] **Map Artifacts**: Burn/Carry matrix defined (See Section 2).
- [ ] **Unified Enforcer**: Merge `psychic_scream.ts` and `enforce.ts` into a single Gen 89 root gate.
- [ ] **Contract Fixation**: Harden the Zod schemas in `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/contracts/`.
- [ ] **Trace Integration**: Prepare Phoenix (Arize) telemetry hooks for the first LangGraph prototype.
