# 🕊️ THE SILVER BATON: HFO GEN 88 TO GEN 89 HANDOFF
**Mission**: Total Tool Virtualization (TTV)  
**Status**: DEEP MINING COMPLETE  
**Handoff Point**: 2026-01-06T12:00:00Z

## 🏗️ 1. SYSTEM STATE (SUMMARY)
- **Signal Coverage**: 100% of `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze` has been semantically chunked.
- **Critical Failure**: `P0_GESTURE_MONOLITH` has been flagged for **Automation Theater**. It reports 100% test success but lacks a functional Vite boot sequence and relies on mocks.
- **The Pivot**: Abandoning the monolith for a 4-stage functional Vertical Slice: **"The Ghost Pen"** (Sense -> Smooth -> Fuse -> Emit).

## 🏛️ 2. ARCHITECTURAL DNA (TO CARRY)
These patterns have been "crystallized" and must survive the Phoenix transition:
1.  **8×8 Galois Lattice**: Use BORING names for ports (SensorIngest, MessageBroker, etc.).
2.  **Medallion Architecture**: Strict Bronze/Silver/Gold tiering.
3.  **Zod Contract Law**: No data crosses a Port boundary without a schema check.
4.  **Psychic Scream (Port 4)**: Hard-gate mutation testing via Stryker.
5.  **Triple Grounding**: Every action must use Search (P0), Thinking (P7), and Memory (P6).

## 🔥 3. THE BURN LIST (TO INCINERATE)
The following must NOT pollute Gen 89:
*   **The Monolith**: All mock-dependent gesture code in P0.
*   **Nested Structure**: Move to a FLAT model (Max 2 levels deep).
*   **Soft Instructions**: Move all rules from `AGENTS.md` into `enforce.ts` (Pre-commit hooks).

## 🚀 4. NEXT MISSION (GEN 89 BOOTSTRAP)
1.  **Initialize the "Boring" Lattice**: Create the functional adapters for the W3C Gesture Plane.
2.  **Deploy the "Ghost Pen"**: Implement the 1€ Filtered index-tip tracker.
3.  **Harden the Gate**: Implement a Playwright E2E "Sanity Test" to replace Mock Theater.
