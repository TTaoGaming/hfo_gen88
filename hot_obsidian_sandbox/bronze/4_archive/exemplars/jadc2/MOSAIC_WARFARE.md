## Definition
MOSAIC Warfare is a DARPA concept that focuses on "composable" and "decentralized" warfare. Instead of large, monolithic systems, it uses a "mosaic" of smaller, cheaper, and more flexible units.

## Application in HFO
In HFO Gen 88, MOSAIC Warfare is applied to software defense-in-depth. Each Port acts as a tile in the mosaic, providing a specific capability that can be combined with others to form a resilient defense.

## Tactical Steps
1. **Observe**: Sense the environment (Port 0).
2. **Orient**: Contextualize the threat (Port 1).
3. **Decide**: Choose a response (Port 7).
4. **Act**: Execute the disruption (Port 4).
