# 🦅 HFO Gen 88: Unified Mission Specification

## 1. STRATEGIC OVERVIEW: THE DISRUPTION PLANE
The mission of HFO Gen 88 (Canalization) is the transition from **Kinetic Sprawl** (Ad-hoc AI Scripting) to **Verified Truth** (Contract-Driven Construction). Total Tool Virtualization (TTV) is the end state.

### The 8 Legendary Commanders (Ports)
1. **P0: Lidless Legion (Sense)** - W3C Gesture Control & Perception.
2. **P1: Web Weaver (Fuse)** - Bridge/Envelope standardization & Interlocking interfaces.
3. **P2: Mirror Magus (Shape)** - Agent definitions & Prompt shaping.
4. **P3: Spore Storm (Deliver)** - Refactoring loops & CI/CD deployment.
5. **P4: Red Regnant (Disrupt)** - Hard-gated enforcement & SCREAM audits.
6. **P5: Pyre Praetorian (Defend)** - Immunization & Runtime guarding.
7. **P6: Kraken Keeper (Store)** - Persistent state & Merkle-ledger receipts.
8. **P7: Spider Sovereign (Orchestrate)** - Navigator for HIVE/8 workflows.

## 2. GOVERNANCE: THE MEDALLION HARD-GATES
No artifact shall pass the gates without meeting the **Goldilocks Threshold**.

*   **BRONZE (Experimentation)**: PARA required. Warnings only. Mutation score: < 80%.
*   **SILVER (Stability)**: Verified TDD. **HARD GATE: > 88% Mutation Score**.
*   **GOLD (Canon)**: Immutable truth. > 99% (Reserve for absolute core logic).

### The Canalization Rules
*   **NO THEATER**: Cosmetic code without tests is a critical violation (SCREAM).
*   **PARA ONLY**: `1_projects/`, `2_areas/`, `3_resources/`, `4_archive/`.
*   **STIGMERGY**: All actions MUST log to the `hot_obsidianblackboard.jsonl`.

## 3. TACTICAL: MAP-ELITE HARNESS
Evolutionary evaluation of LLM performance across the disruption plane.
- **Fitness**: Accuracy x Efficiency x Orchestration Success.
- **Harness**: 8-harness architecture mapped to Ports.
- **Ledger**: Hash-chained evaluation results in `3_resources`.

## 4. IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
1. **Harden P1 Bridge**: Standardize all envelope objects to HFO-MCP schema.
2. **P6 Ledger Implementation**: Move from JSONL to Merkle-chained receipts.
3. **Theater Purge**: Reach 88% mutation score for all core detectors.

**Provenance**: Unified from 12 scattered specs on 2026-01-08.
**Status**: ACTIVE / HARD-GATED.
