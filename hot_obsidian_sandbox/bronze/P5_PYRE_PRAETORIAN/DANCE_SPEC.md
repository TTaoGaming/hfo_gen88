# 🔥 Port 5: Pyre Praetorian (DANCE_SPEC)

Topic: System Disruption & Testing
Provenance: hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/P5_PYRE_PRAETORIAN/DANCE_SPEC.md
Status: BRONZE (Active Hardening)

## 🎯 Mission
The Pyre Praetorian is the proactive defender of the HFO Gen 88 Cleanroom. While the Red Regnant (Port 4) screams at violations, the Praetorian performs the **Pyre Dance** to harden the system and prevent screams from occurring.

## 💃 The Pyre Dance
The dance consists of three primary steps:

1.  **SWEEP**: Proactively identifies and moves root pollution to `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/quarantine/pollution/`.
2.  **SEAL**: Hardens the `.gitignore` and other configuration files to prevent "slop" from entering the version control system.
3.  **SHIELD**: (Future) Automated wrapping of `silver/` exports in `VacuoleEnvelope` to ensure contract law is followed.

## 🔄 The Strange Loop
The Pyre Praetorian and the Red Regnant exist in a co-evolutionary "Strange Loop":
- **Red Regnant**: Disrupts and identifies weaknesses (Yang).
- **Pyre Praetorian**: Hardens and remediates (Yin).

Together, they ensure the system evolves towards higher integrity without human intervention.
