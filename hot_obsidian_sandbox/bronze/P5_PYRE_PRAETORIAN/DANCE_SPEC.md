# 🔥 Port 5: Pyre Praetorian (DANCE_SPEC)

Topic: System Disruption & Testing
Provenance: hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/P5_PYRE_PRAETORIAN/DANCE_SPEC.md
Status: BRONZE (Active Hardening)

## 🎯 Mission
The Pyre Praetorian is the proactive defender of the HFO Gen 88 Cleanroom. While the Red Regnant (Port 4) screams at violations, the Praetorian performs the **Pyre Dance** to harden the system and prevent screams from occurring.

## 💃 The Pyre Dance
The dance consists of four primary steps:

1.  **SWEEP**: Proactively identifies and moves root pollution to `hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/quarantine/pollution/`.
2.  **SEAL**: Hardens the `.gitignore` and other configuration files to prevent "slop" from entering the version control system.
3.  **SHIELD**: Audits `silver/` for `VacuoleEnvelope` compliance, "Theater" (TODOs/empty blocks), and "Hallucinations" (invalid imports).
4.  **PULSE**: Verifies a recent "Test Success" signal in the `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` to prevent "Optimistic Override."

## 🛡️ Defense in Depth Layers

1.  **Zod (Contract Law)**: All public exports must be wrapped in `VacuoleEnvelope` to ensure data integrity.
2.  **Pre-commit (The Gatekeeper)**: Runs the Pyre Dance and Psychic Scream before any code is committed.
3.  **TDD/CDD (The Proof)**: No implementation in `silver/` without a corresponding test.
4.  **Stigmergy (The Memory)**: All audits and test results are logged to `obsidianblackboard.jsonl`.
5.  **Import Audit (The Reality Check)**: Prevents AI from hallucinating non-existent libraries.
6.  **Theater Detection (The Anti-Slop)**: Blocks commits containing `TODO` or empty implementations in `silver/`.

## 📉 Addressing DEV PAIN

The Pyre Praetorian is specifically designed to block the "Death Loops" identified in the `PAIN_REGISTRY_GEN88.md`. By forcing the AI to fight through these layers, we ensure that only high-integrity, verified code reaches the `silver/` and `gold/` tiers.

## 🔄 The Strange Loop
The Pyre Praetorian and the Red Regnant exist in a co-evolutionary "Strange Loop":
- **Red Regnant**: Disrupts and identifies weaknesses (Yang).
- **Pyre Praetorian**: Hardens and remediates (Yin).

Together, they ensure the system evolves towards higher integrity without human intervention.
