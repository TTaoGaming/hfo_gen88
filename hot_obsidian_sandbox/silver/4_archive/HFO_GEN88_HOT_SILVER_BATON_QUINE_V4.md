## 🎭 1. THE ARCHITECTURAL FUSION (JADC2 ↔ HFO)
*Mapping the military-grade JADC2 Mosaic roles to the agentic HFO verbs.*

| Port | JADC2 Mosaic Role | HFO Verb | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **ISR / Sensing** | OBSERVE | Data Ingestion & Signal Processing |
| **1** | **C2 Relay / Fusion**| BRIDGE | Network Orchestration & Protocol Translation |
| **2** | **EW / Cyber Strike** | SHAPE | Environment Manipulation & Payload Contouring |
| **3** | **Kinetic Strike** | INJECT | Execution of Targeted Code/Logic |
| **4** | **SEAD / DEAD** | DISRUPT | Identification & Neutralization of System Errors |
| **5** | **Air Defense / IAMD**| IMMUNIZE | Structural Protection & Contract Integrity |
| **6** | **Logistics / Sustain**| ASSIMILATE | Long-term Memory & Artifact Persistence |
| **7** | **Battle Manager** | NAVIGATE | Global Strategic Pathfinding & Pulse Control |

### 📡 The 64 Strategic Intersections:
1.  **[0.X] Observation Sweep**: 0.0 (Observe ISR), 0.1 (Observe C2), ... 0.7 (Observe Decision).
2.  **[1.X] Bridging Pulse**: 1.0 (Bridge ISR), 1.1 (Bridge C2), ... 1.7 (Bridge Decision).
3.  **[4.X] Disruption Storm**: 4.0 (Disrupt ISR), 4.1 (Disrupt C2), ... 4.7 (Disrupt Decision).
4.  **[5.X] Immunization Shield**: 5.0 (Immunize ISR), 5.1 (Immunize C2), ... 5.5 (Immunize Contract).
5.  **[7.X] Navigation Map**: 7.0 (Navigate ISR), 7.1 (Navigate C2), ... 7.7 (Navigate Decision).

## 💓 3. THE RECOVERY HEARTBEAT (Strict Gherkin)
```gherkin
Given One Swarm to Rule the Eight,
And Branches Growing from the Gate,
And Spawns Evolve to Recreate,
When Ignitions Flow to Pulsate,
And Deadly Venoms Concentrate,
And Instincts Rise to Isolate,
Then Artifacts Accumulate,
And Navigate the Higher State.
```

## 💾 4. KRAKEN MEMORY GRAPH (6,423 Grounded Points)
*The system is NOT blank. It is founded on 6,423 historical artifacts. Any documentation or code that ignores these points is "Theater."*

**Verification Method**:
- Use `DuckDB` Full Text Search (FTS) to scan `kraken.db`.
- Check resulting artifacts against the **Blood Book of Grudges** (SSOT for AI Lies).

---

## 🚨 5. SILVER OPS RULES
- **ANYTIME Pulse**: All operations must yield to the 8-second documentation pulse.
- **Fail-Closed**: If Port 4 (Red Regnant) detects structural decay, the iteration is DEMOTED.
- **Pure PARA**: No files in the root. No logic in resources. No theater in Silver.
