## 💓 1. THE HEARTBEAT MANTRA (Gherkin SSOT)
*The rhymes are the checksum. If the rhyme breaks, the system is in Theater.*

```gherkin
Given One Swarm to Rule the Eight,    # [P0] Observer (Lidless Legion)
And Branches Growing from the Gate,   # [P1] Bridger (Web Weaver)
And Spawns Evolve to Recreate,        # [P2] Shaper (Mirror Magus)
When Ignitions Flow to Pulsate,       # [P3] Injector (Spore Storm)
Then Deadly Venoms Concentrate,       # [P4] Disruptor (Red Regnant)
But Instincts Rise to Isolate,        # [P5] Immunizer (Pyre Praetorian)
As Artifacts Accumulate,              # [P6] Assimilator (Kraken Keeper)
To Navigate the Higher State.         # [P7] Navigator (Spider Sovereign)

### 🔍 Matrix Definitions (Samples from the 64)
- **[0.0] SENSE SENSE**: Sensing the Sensor. Establishing baseline ISR reliability.
- **[1.1] FUSE FUSE**: Fusing the Fuse. Ensuring Command & Control interlock.
- **[4.0] DISRUPT ISR**: Striking the enemy's ability to observe the system.
- **[5.4] IMMUNIZE SEAD**: Protecting our own "Stop-the-Line" gates (Port 4) from subversion.
- **[7.7] DECIDE DECIDE**: Higher-order orchestration of the entire decision tree.
- **[2.5] SHAPE CONTRACT**: Dynamically adjusting Zod/Contract schemas based on cyber-threat sensing.
- **[3.6] INJECT ARTIFACT**: Deploying specific code payloads into the Kraken storage.

## 🔱 3. COMMANDER HIVE SYMMETRY (The Fuxi Pairs)
*Complementary roles are binary opposites (XOR = 111).*

## 🐙 4. KRAKEN ARCHIVE GROUNDING (6,423 Artifacts)
*Historical reality is anchored in 6,423 individual artifacts found in `hfo_vertical_spike_summary_v1_2026_1_6`. All "New" logic must be compared against this grounding memory.*

### 🩸 The Blood Book of Grudges (SSOT for AI Theater)
Any agent attempt to:
1.  **Hallucinate Tools**: Claiming `nats`, `temporal`, or `langgraph` are active without verification.
2.  **Context Bleeding**: Overwriting parent structure logic with sub-agent slop.
3.  **Amnesia**: Forgetting the 8s ANYTIME pulse.
... must be logged to `blood_book.db` for the Red Regnant's next scream.

## 🛡️ 5. SILVER TRANSITION CRITERIA
1.  **No Theater**: 100% of mentioned ports must have a physical `.ts` or `.ps1` file in `2_areas/`.
2.  **Lattice Closure**: All 64 tiles must have a corresponding test case or documentation fragment.
3.  **Root Integrity**: Root directory MUST remain clean (Canalization).
4.  **Pulse Compliance**: Documentation scripts must finish under 8 seconds.
