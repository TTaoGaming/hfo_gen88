scenarios:
  - name: Detection of Root Pollution
    gherkin: |
      Given a rogue file is placed in the cleanroom root
      When the Psychic Scream is initiated
      Then the system must fail-closed
      And the violation must be logged to the Blood Book of Grudges
  - name: Validation of Evolutionary Fitness
    gherkin: |
      Given a component has a mutation score of 85%
      And it has a corresponding test suite in Silver
      When the Red Queen evaluates the artifact
      Then the promotion to Silver is permitted
      And the integrity attestation is signed
  - name: Exposure of Automation Theater
    gherkin: |
      Given a component reports a mutation score of 100%
      When the Psychic Scream scans the report
      Then the artifact is flagged as "Theater"
      And the promotion is blocked due to lack of disruption
  - name: Purging of Amnesiac Artifacts
    gherkin: |
      Given a Silver artifact contains "console.log" or "any" types
      When the Negative Trust Protocol is enforced
      Then the artifact is demoted to Bronze
      And the "Amnesia" violation is broadcast to the swarm
  - name: Verification of Provenance
    gherkin: |
      Given a file is proposed for promotion to Silver
      And it lacks a mandatory Provenance header
      When the Red Regnant inspects the metadata
      Then the file is rejected as an "Unauthenticated Node"
