## 🕸️ The 8x8 Semantic Manifold (X: Actor | Y: Domain)

The Galois Lattice defines the **Purpose** of every agent interaction in the swarm.

### 🛡️ The Legendary Diagonal (X = Y): Self-Referential Quines
*When a Commander acts upon their own domain, they perform meta-optimization.*

- **(0,0) OBSERVE the OBSERVE**: Meta-sensing. Calibrating sensors, filtering noise, and verifying ISR integrity.
- **(1,1) BRIDGE the BRIDGE**: Protocol stabilization. Hardening the nervous system and optimizing the web's latency.
- **(2,2) SHAPE the SHAPE**: Morphological evolution. Refactoring polymorphic adapters and UI primitives.
- **(3,3) INJECT the INJECT**: Recursive delivery. Optimizing the spore storm's cascade and emission rate.
- **(4,4) DISRUPT the DISRUPT**: Chaos engineering. Testing the test suite and red-teaming the Red Regnant.
- **(5,5) IMMUNIZE the IMMUNIZE**: Security hardening. Defending the defenders and verifying the Pyre's integrity.
- **(6,6) ASSIMILATE the ASSIMILATE**: Memory compression. Indexing the datalake and optimizing MAP ELITE storage.
- **(7,7) NAVIGATE the NAVIGATE**: Strategic reflection. The Spider Sovereign deciding on the decision-making process.

### 🐝 The HIVE Anti-Diagonal (X + Y = 7): Strategic Synergy
*These pairings drive the HFO Strategic Lifecycle.*

- **(0,7) & (7,0) HUNT**: The Lidless Legion senses what the Spider Sovereign decides to target.
- **(1,6) & (6,1) INTERLOCK**: The Web Weaver bridges the data that the Kraken Keeper assimilates.
- **(2,5) & (5,2) VALIDATE**: The Mirror Magus shapes the forms that the Pyre Praetorian immunizes.
- **(3,4) & (4,3) EVOLVE**: The Spore Storm injects the changes that the Red Regnant disrupts.

## 🎮 Operational Playbooks (Battle Drills)

### 🦅 Drill 1: Tactical PREY (Base 8)
*Used for rapid tool interaction and micro-execution.*
1. **PERCEIVE (P0)**: Lidless Legion gathers raw telemetry.
2. **REACT (P1)**: Web Weaver wraps telemetry in a `Vacuole` envelope.
3. **EXECUTE (P2)**: Mirror Magus transforms the envelope for the target tool.
4. **YIELD (P3)**: Spore Storm delivers the result to the next node.

### 🐝 Drill 2: Strategic HIVE (Base 8)
*Used for feature development and system evolution.*
1. **HUNT (P0+P7)**: Researching the "Gold" exemplar and defining the mission fit.
2. **INTERLOCK (P1+P6)**: Defining the Zod contracts and assimilating them into memory.
3. **VALIDATE (P2+P5)**: Shaping the implementation and immunizing it with TDD/CDD.
4. **EVOLVE (P3+P4)**: Injecting the code and disrupting it with mutation testing.

## 📜 Policy as Code (The Law)

1. **Port 1 Authority**: No data flows without a Web Weaver bridge. All heterogenous data must be wrapped in an HFO Standardized Envelope.
2. **Port 4/5 Eternal Dance**: Every implementation (P5) must be accompanied by a disruption test (P4).
3. **Port 6 Medallion Flow**: Data must progress from Bronze (Experiment) to Silver (Verified) to Gold (Canonical).
4. **Port 7 Will**: The Spider Sovereign is the only entity that can initiate a HIVE loop.
