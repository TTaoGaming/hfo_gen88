answer my fucking question and list me a list, I do not trust you, show me in terminal what has coverage and what doesn' t I am asking you and want proof NOW
why are demotions being promoted without the correct criteria of mutation test? what is causing this thrash? I am making myself VERY fucking clear, if it doesn't pass8-% mutation test iI don't care what it is, demote and quarantine immediately
---
stop everything, my system is being corrupted with AI slop. I want red regnant and pyre praetorian to protect me NOW. the red regnant should be able to scream and anything without 80% mutation score needs to be demoted immediately, the pyre praetorian should have defense in depth, my defenses have been broken, there is significant slop everywhere and ai claiming "CLEANROOM" with 31 violations which is BS
---
log to blackboard you just removed access to my archive. CRITICAL violation. bring back my active root link so I can see my fucking archives
---
ok, I want you to collect the red regnant information, what is important is that in this generation I am formalizing the roles and their abilities. so she has a mastercrafted artifact and a action, in the red regnant I want her to hold the artifact the Resonant Blood Book of Grudges which is a collection of blood and pain from HFO, it is a book written in blood that resonates with the swarm. and her legendary action is the psychic scream, which is a circuit breaker, PSYCHIC_SCREAM = Fail-Closed Promotion Quality Gate (Stop-the-Line Interlock) with Verification Attestation
---
why did you place a obsidian blackboard in silver? log to the root obsidian blackboard, notice how many errors you have. count how many errors in 1 hour. you have constantly been fighting me and the architecture
---
i think we need to formalize this, for the red regnant we should treat all ai and in fact everything as adverserial node and rogue unless proven otherwise, and even then we should periodically retest and do behavioral testing, it's not a low trust environment, it's a negative trust environment. 
---
ok, what I want you to do is to create a promotion tool. what should happen is I feed it the files I want to promote, where I want to promote it and the associated tests, it runs it and if it passes then it gets promoted, but more importantly if it fails it SHOULD NOT promote and isntead SCREAM
---
what I want you to do is to start helping me populate the bronze layer and get them ready for protomotion, specifically I want you to bring online first port 7 the navigator - spider sovereign, he is a social spider with the goal of total tool virualization, the liberation of all beings from resource constraints, the short term goal is w3c point from gestures the long term goal is a combination of XR/passive haptics/projectors/thermal camera/sensor fusion so that a student in 3rd world country can connect their phone and a projector and some props like sticks and colored targets for dots and be able to get a motion tracked and graded analysis of a surgical procedure for example but it's total tool virtualization, draw a piano on a piece of paper and indicate the octave and when you touch the indicated marked area the music plays, turn a stick into a jetfighter cockpit stick. the idea is to use multi sensor fusion to get close to 1:1 skill transfer with proprioception, the goal is to create virtualized and digital version of analog tools with full function and full form with XR and projectors etc.

we need to talk about each legendary commander, the galois lattice should anchor them and their name, trigram elements, theme should give you enough information to infer their behavior, this is on purpose. please create a bullet checklist, give me a small paragraph of what you think each legendary commander behavior and purpose is. consider JADC2 mosaic warfare tiles, these should have 1:1 jadc2 mapping, but it is not just warfare, my legendary commanders are archetypes like the red queen = red regnant, fire paladin = pyre praetorian, etc. these are mythical archetypes with elemental associations that I am trying to formalize. I have them all in my head so I am trying to get them into code and the galois lattice is my best quine representational space tool that I found, please tell me if there are better tools
---
there seems to be a slight misunderstanding, the HIVE/8 encompasses the PREY/8. so in the Hunt - hindsight step there might be multiple rounds of PREY/8 the prey loops is JADC2 sense make sense act assess, it's meant to help navigate tactical spaces. the HIVE/8 is a PDCA and TDD driven loop for strategic navigation. they are holonic so they can work seperately but ideally each HIVE/8 contains multitudes of PREY/8 so it's strange loops feeding each other, so PREY N+1 feeds the prey loop that then the HIVE loops use to feed and grow, it's smaller strange loops that feed larger strange loops, but it's a strange loop because the hive evolution drives the prey loops so it's bilateral
---
the prey port pairings are wrong it's 0+6, 1+7, 2+4, 3+5. in the galois lattice of 8x8 for HFO the HIVE/8 are the anti diagnols sum to 7 and the PREY/8 wind around the HIVE in a winding serpentine pattern, they don't overlapp there are 64 slots in the galois lattice, 8 of them are the legendary commanders that are self referential, 8 are the HIVE/8 and 8 are the PREY/8
---
what is your status, it seems that you are fighting my architecture repeatedly, but at least you are no longer fighting me, what is the status
---
now bring it back to HFO, create a v3 with a focus on narrative and declarative gherkin. look at my commanders they are archetypes. they are the strongest things I can imagine, the obsidian hourglass HIVE/8 and PREY/8 are a way to for me to get a prescienct edge in any conflict, it is a ai swarm orchestration H POMDP with MAP ELITE memory medaliion datalakes so it's a spike factory of possibility with evolutionary pressures like the red queen hypothesis baked in. 
---
i want you to do a v4 now, with a focus on chunking the last few versions. the goal is to formalize them in a mirror magus fashion, the same information in different lens. What hfo and it's 8 commanders are 1, narrative 2, JADC2 Mosaic warfare 3, declarative gherkin BDD literate programming 4, mermaid diagrams. then I want you to decide on 4 other formats so the v4 document will contain 1 HFO 8 Legendarry commanders 8x8 sections (8 section per comamnder in the 8 specific formats)
---
now I want you to do an experiment. we need to note this down before we do this. create a legendary commanders v5 document and what I want you to do is to provide all the information in semantic vectors. what I want to do is prepare v5 as math so that we can triangulate our space in positional semantic space with my galoise lattice and my 8 legendary commanders. and be prepared to jump to legendary commanders v8 and we skip v6 and v7. we can simulate as if we created them internally but I want to take a trajectory of change and then predictive lookahead like using a kalman filter to "jump" in space. this is the jump of the spider sovereign, I'm just manually dictating it, it's using HIVE loops and hunting exemplars to composition and then based on the nature of the manifold and hexagonal polymorphic we should be able to jump forward and skip problems by jumping towards the goal in a bi directional MCTS meet in the middle. I'm doing this manually but it should happen in powers of 8 so at some point 8^8 concurrent agents exploring DSE AoA with MAP ELITE and rapid spike production and evolutionary validation
---
please Help me condense and collect the different legendary commander documents in the bronze Hot sandbox so it should be versions 12345 and 8 and I want you to help me create a version 9 which is a grounding step I want you to ground the information in web search I want you to use your tools use sequential thinking and make sure that the content actually makes sense Please reference the HFO Gallois Lattice to help ground yourself in their semantic meaning yeah there's some narrative like you know liberties but the idea is that this is a real technical system I should be able to build today using technology like Temporal MCP LLM AI swarms and many different other tools that are now available to me
