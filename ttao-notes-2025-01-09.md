update memory mcp and memory systems with these progress and incidents. if they have their mutation goldilocks tamper evident receipt then they should be moved with their receipt into the cold bronze para layer. so the flow should be Hot = kinetic and shifting, lots of files moving around and "dancing" then when it passes my tests it gets cooled into the cold bronze for stability and read only/archive. once we stabilize in cold then we can work on promotion que to hot silver then cold silver then hot gold then cold gold. so it flows through 6 refinement steps hot/cold kinetic medallion PARA

ok, add that hot to cold medallion flow to agents.md and the hive8 agent. so it's clear that if anything moves from hot bronze to hot silver that should trigger an tripwire. and if they move from hot bronze to cold bronze they need testing receipts with hashing for tamper evident

we need to add in 2 fianl stages beyond gold. called hyper fractal obsidian, which will sit above gold. so I have 8 stages in total. right now we only have hot bronze, cold bronze, and a little hot silver. but 0 cold silver 0 gold 0 hyper fractal obsidian. they will be worked on, the goal is 8 stages and at the end the code should be MAP ELITE with HFO synergies built into the foundation so the swarm can work together effortlessly like slivers

every unit in my 64 card deck is already a sliver, the mirror magus mirror entity allows me to use any non sliver cards as a sliver, allowing synergy exploits

i am doing a para structure in obsidian app mobile for my cellphone. what I want is to concense the info here so that I can sync it with mobile. but this workspace has too many work and files for it to be useable what I want you to do is help me look at my recent works, especially the mtg cards and legendary commanders as JADC2 MOSAIC SLIVERS MTG narrative. the word i've been looking for is HFO is a APEX ENSEMBLE MOSAIC WARFARE MISSION ENGINEERING PLATFORM using AI STIGMERGY SWARM ORCHESTRATION

i know github copilot has access to my mcp and my sovereign soul memory systems, can you help me search for them? it is in this repo i just think kiro is not set up correctly to interface yet which is a huge code smell, we should be vendor and IDE agnostic but this shows me we are not
