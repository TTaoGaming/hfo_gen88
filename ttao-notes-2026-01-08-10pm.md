run it for me and help me stay on track with this, I really want a persistant HFO state at the minimum, and ideally we start having memory for each of my commanders so I'll need at least 1 meta state and 8 legendary commander states
---
start ingesting the memory mcp and the obsidian blackboards to understand our progress, I am literally laying stigmergy obsidian blackboards for you with stigmergy markers for you to use
---
let's merge the concept, let's call the blue phoenix shield of ressurection? wnad we have incriptions on it as part of the pyre praetorian
---
ok we need to set up the sovereign soul better, what does the system remember and how does it remember? explaom it all to me with plain language analogies. are we using open router or does this work with github copilot?
---
ok, you need to test open router for me so we can talk with them, if you can give me a GUI that would be helpful. and which models are used and which HFO workflows are set up i think HIVE/8 and PREY/8 are not ready yet
---
vitest files are not surviving the red regnant when they should in bronze, i think the issue is the root
---
now read the version 1 to 4 and understand what I am trying to do. this is a small vertical slice of what I imagine the shaper can do on a mass scale. a polymorphic spike factory to explore decision space, you need to understand and use sequential thinking, web search, context7 and save to memory
---
i want you to create a new hot bronze document with more card alternatives, give me different ideas for pairing that matches my narrative and jadc2 vision, this is my LEGENDARY commanders and they are incarnations of an archetype with HFO flavor
---
i am trialing this new hive8 agent, please help me search memory systems and remember what I want to build for total tool virtualization. what dependencies are ready and what are not yet
