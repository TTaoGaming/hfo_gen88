Fundamentally what I want to do is to set up this cold start correctly I have around one year of work from 2025 I have all the proof of concepts and demos you would need We have all the building pieces we need to now compose them in my actual HFO architecture So what I want you to do is to create a checklist first let's have you create an HFO bronze and then we'll promote it to silver as necessary etc The idea is that the bronze layers can be full of trash it doesn't really matter right we can just burn everything in the bronze It really shouldn't matter If it's important then it gets promoted over to Silver which needs to have a provenance from bronze so you can't just create a silver level document you need to create the bronze level document and then promote it through a specific Hive fleet Obsidium process Right now everything's in my head and the main goal is to get it to be machine enforceable architecture So I want you to go and take a read through Generation 87X3 that's the one I was just working on It has a lot of proof of concepts it has a lot of stuff working it has a lot of tests there's lots of pieces there but we can't import it directly because it's full of hallucination in fact we can assume that bronze layer always has a hallucination like anyone who thinks the bronze layer is full of gold is **** stupid 'cause it's literally bronze
