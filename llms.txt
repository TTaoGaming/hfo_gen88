Provenance: bronze/P4_DISRUPTION_KINETIC.md

> Generation: 88
> Status: IMMUNE SYSTEM PROMOTED TO SILVER
> Status: HARD-GATED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVE

## 🎯 CURRENT MISSION: W3C Gesture Control Plane

**→ WORK IN hot_obsidian_sandbox/ ←**

- **Bronze**: Slop, kinetic energy, experiments.
- **Silver**: Verified, tested implementations.
- **Gold**: Canonical manifests (currently empty).

## Architecture: Canalization

Gen 88 is designed to prevent "AI Theater" through strict architectural gates.
- **The Red Queen (Port 4)**: Sings when code is pure; Screams on violations.
- **The Blue Phoenix (Port 5)**: Immolates slop in blue flames; rebirths through the Phoenix Protocol.
- **Root Purge**: No pollution allowed in the root.
- **Medallion Architecture**: Strict separation of data quality.
- **Stigmergy**: `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` is the source of truth.
- **Blood Book**: `RED_BOOK_OF_BLOOD_GRUDGES.jsonl` tracks violations.

## Key Files

1. **AGENTS.md** - Full agent instructions and rules.
2. **obsidianblackboard.jsonl** - The Truth Source (Root).
3. **BLOOD_BOOK_OF_GRUDGES.jsonl** - The Ledger of Pain (Port 4).
4. **hot_obsidian_sandbox/silver/P5_PYRE_PRAETORIAN/pyre_dance.ts** - Proactive Hardening (Port 5).
5. **hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/infra/** - Testing and enforcement infrastructure.

## Rules for LLMs

1. **NO HALLUCINATIONS**: Cite the Blackboard or specific files.
2. **NO ROOT POLLUTION**: Keep the root clean.
3. **TDD MANDATORY**: No code in `silver/` without tests.
4. **LOG EVERYTHING**: Every violation and progress step must be on the Blackboard.

## The Mantra

> "The spider weaves the web that weaves the spider."
