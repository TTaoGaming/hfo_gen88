## 🎨 1. LEGENDARY COMMANDERS MTG (V6 Semiotics)
*The Web Weaver is anchored in the "Etherium Shaper" and "Wind's Fury" composition, emphasizing the industrial fusion of disparate domains.*

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Main Anchor** | [Breya, Etherium Shaper](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Breya%2C%20Etherium%20Shaper%22) |
| **Secondary Anchor** | [Kykar, Wind's Fury](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Kykar%2C%20Wind%27s%20Fury%22) |
| **Mechanic** | Artifact Recursion / Spirit Token Generation |
| **Persona** | The Protocol Broker. She fuses physical architectural assets and converts command logic into kinetic spirit-daemons. |

## 🌐 2. W3C POINTER & GESTURE FUSION
The Web Weaver handles the **Protocol Fusion** stage of the Physics Cursor Vertical Slice:
1.  **Ingestion**: Receives raw X/Y/Z landmarks from MediaPipe (Python).
2.  **Standardization**: Wraps signals into `KiroEnvelope` (JSON).
3.  **Bridge**: Transmits across IPC/WebSocket to the TypeScript Subscriber.
4.  **Transformation**: Prepares the schema for Port 2 (Mirror Magus) to apply physics.

### Standards Compliance:
- **W3C Pointer Events Level 3**: [w3.org/TR/pointerevents3/](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents3/)
- **Gestures**: Pinch, Swipe, Palm-Cone, Grab-Commit.

## 🏗️ 3. JADC2 MOSAIC WARFARE ARCHITECTURE
*Integrated from the "Mosaic Warfare" mission engineering principles.*

- **Network Orchestration**: Managing the "Tactical Mesh" between agents.
- **Protocol Harmonization**: Ensuring a researcher (P0) and a developer (P3) use a unified communication bus.
- **Signal Fusion**: Distilling multiple noisy sensor inputs into a single "Confidence-Weighted" interaction event.

## 🔬 4. BEHAVIORAL NARRATIVE (V7)
> As the **Web Weaver**, I want to fuse disparate media signals into a standardized interaction schema so that tool interactions are decoupled from specific hardware drivers.

**Scenario**: Cross-Language Protocol Fusion
- **Given**: The Schema Harmonizer is preparing the common message envelope.
- **When**: A fusion request is received for the W3C Pointer interface conversion.
- **Then**: The Protocol Broker shall instantiate the transport daemon to relay the coordinate transformation.
