# ⚔️ HFO Gen 88: JADC2 Mosaic Warfare Manifest (Version 8)
## Mission Engineering: Distributed Kill-Web Orchestration

> **Status**: OPERATIONAL MISSION SPECIFICATION
> **Revision**: Gen 88 (V8)
> **Doctrine**: JADC2 (Joint All-Domain Command & Control) + DARPA Mosaic Warfare
> **Goal**: Total Tool Virtualization (MediaPipeline -> Physics Cursor -> W3C Pointer Interface)
> **Note**: This version translates the HFO architecture into Mission Engineering (ME) terminology. It replaces archetypes with "Force Elements" and "Kill-Web Nodes," prioritizing resilient, disaggregated effects over linear software execution.

## 🎖️ Port 0: ISR Node (Lidless Legion)
**Function**: Persistent Multi-Modal Observation (SENSE)
  As the **ISR Node**,
  I maintain constant multi-modal observation of the operational environment
  So that the Mission Thread is anchored to real-time ground-truth telemetry.

**Mission Thread**: Persistent Sensor Acquisition
  Given the **Signal Observer** is acquiring the high-frequency MediaPipeline stream
  And the **Synchronous Telemetry Guard** is aligning sensor frames to the Master Mission Clock
  When a raw observation packet is ingested from the sensor manifold
  Then the **Signal Observer** shall transform the telemetry into a standardized Target Folder (Zod)
  And the **Synchronous Telemetry Guard** shall certify the frame-sync for downstream fusion.

---

## 🎖️ Port 1: Cross-Domain Gateway (Web Weaver)
**Function**: Data Fabric Integration & Schema Harmonization (FUSE)
  As the **Cross-Domain Gateway**,
  I bridge disparate waveforms and protocols into a unified Data Fabric
  So that force elements can communicate across heterogeneous software domains.

**Mission Thread**: Unified Data Fabric Fusion
  Given the **Fabric Harmonizer** is preparing the unified message envelope
  And the **Waveform Translator** is bridging Python-based sensors to TypeScript-based effectors
  When a cross-domain fusion request is initiated for event transformation
  Then the **Fabric Harmonizer** shall validate the payload against the Federated Mission Schema
  And the **Waveform Translator** shall relay the harmonized telemetry through the Mosaic Interconnect.

## 🎖️ Port 2: Shadow Object / Mission Model (Mirror Magus)
**Function**: Digital Twin Simulation & COA Generation (SHAPE)
  As the **Shadow Object**,
  I maintain a high-fidelity digital twin of the engagement surface
  So that Courses of Action (COAs) can be simulated at machine speed.

**Mission Thread**: Predictive Course of Action (COA) Simulation
  Given the **Shadow Object Host** is maintaining the virtual transform of the interaction manifold
  And the **Morphic Modeler** is simulating physics-compliant engagement bounds
  When movement telemetry is updated in the shadow manifold
  Then the **Shadow Object Host** shall generate machine-speed COAs for cursor positioning
  And the **Morphic Modeler** shall adapt the engagement profile to negate OS-level hardware collisions.

---

## 🎖️ Port 3: Kill-Web Disseminator (Spore Storm)
**Function**: High-Velocity Effect Delivery (DELIVER)
  As the **Kill-Web Disseminator**,
  I route tactical events through the interaction web with sub-millisecond latency
  So that the mission objective is achieved via high-velocity non-kinetic engagement.

**Mission Thread**: Rapid Tactical Injection
  Given the **Fabric Router** is managing the granular delivery of W3C Pointer events
  And the **Injection Assembly** is preparing the tactical packet swarm
  When a simulated COA is approved by the decision logic
  Then the **Fabric Router** shall convert the mission transform into PointerEvent primitives
  And the **Injection Assembly** shall dispatch the effects into the tool's event-loop with sub-millisecond precision.

---

## 🎖️ Port 4: Non-Kinetic Disruption (Red Regnant)
**Function**: Electronic Warfare & Cognitive Overload (DISRUPT)
  As the **Non-Kinetic Disruption** node,
  I saturate the adversary OODA loop by silencing native signals and injecting mosaic complexity
  So that physical hardware dependencies are neutralized in favor of the virtual chain.

**Mission Thread**: Asymmetric Signal Suppression
  Given the **Electronic Warfare (EW) Module** is identifying physical interrupt noise
  And the **Complexity Engine** is generating "noise" to mask the virtualized signal path
  When native hardware attempts to override the mission-critical virtual manifold
  Then the **EW Module** shall suppress the physical interrupt resonance
  And the **Complexity Engine** shall ensure the virtual chain maintains dominance over the local hardware stack.

---

## 🎖️ Port 5: ROE Engine / Decoupled Resiliency (Pyre Praetorian)
**Function**: Rules of Engagement (ROE) Enforcement (DEFEND)
  As the **ROE Engine**,
  I enforce the legal and tactical boundaries of the engagement
  So that mission integrity is maintained and "AI Theater" is prohibited.

**Mission Thread**: Immutable ROE Verification
  Given the **State Validator** is auditing the cursor's ground-truth coordinates
  And the **ROE Guard** is enforcing static coordinate invariance and safety bounds
  When a state-drift violation of the ROE is detected
  Then the **State Validator** shall trigger an automated mission abort or re-alignment
  And the **ROE Guard** shall reset the engagement to the last validated Mission Model state.

---

## 🎖️ Port 6: Battle Log / AAR System (Kraken Keeper)
**Function**: Post-Mission Analysis & Persistent State (STORE)
  As the **AAR System**,
  I preserve the high-frequency mission history for After-Action Reviews (AAR)
  So that the Kill-Web can evolve through recursive analytical iteration.

**Mission Thread**: High-Resolution AAR Persistence
  Given the **Analytical Historian** is ingesting 1000Hz mission telemetry
  And the **Cold-Storage Archive** is persisting the engagement history in DuckDB
  When an engagement vignette is completed
  Then the **Cold-Storage Archive** shall commit the raw telemetry logs to the analytical manifold
  And the **Analytical Historian** shall index the data for predictive mission-modeling in future sorties.

---

## 🎖️ Port 7: BMC2 / Context Orchestrator (Spider Sovereign)
**Function**: Battle Management Command & Control (NAVIGATE)
  As the **BMC2 Node**,
  I orchestrate the dynamic assembly of Composable Force Packages across all domains
  So that the Hive maintains global command over the virtualized Kill-Web.

**Mission Thread**: Dynamic Kill-Web Orchestration
  As per the **JADC2 Vision**,
  Given the **Context Orchestrator** is tracking cross-domain mission transitions
  And the **Force Navigator** is routing the strategic intent across the tool-mosaic
  When the mission requires a transition between heterogeneous software platforms
  Then the **Context Orchestrator** shall recompose the Force Package for the new domain
  And the **Force Navigator** shall ensure seamless sensor-to-effector linkage across the entire Kill-Web.
