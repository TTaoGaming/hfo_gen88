# 🎭 HFO Gen 88: Behavioral Narrative Archetypes (Version 7)
## Total Tool Virtualization: MediaPipeline to Physics Cursor

> **Status**: PURE ARCHETYPAL SPECIFICATION
> **Revision**: Gen 88 (V7)
> **Goal**: Total Tool Virtualization (MediaPipeline -> Physics Cursor -> W3C Pointer Interface)
> **Note**: This version abstracts the semiotic MTG anchors into pure behavioral roles. It defines the "Verbs" and "Scenarios" required for the TypeScript/Python interaction architecture without external card-based references.

## 🎖️ Port 0: The Lidless Legion (SENSE)
**Role**: High-Fidelity Signal Observer
  As the **Lidless Legion**,
  I want to ingest environmental media pipelines and telemetry signals
  So that the virtualized tool manifold has a raw signal-of-truth.

**Scenario**: Signal Buffer Capture and Frame Sync
  Given the **Primary Sensor** is parsing the high-frequency architectural stream
  And the **Temporal Synchronizer** is aligning the frame buffers with the manifold clock
  When the MediaPipeline (Python/OpenCV) emits a new sensor packet
  Then the **Primary Sensor** shall deserialize the raw buffer into a high-dimensional state vector (Zod validated)
  And the **Temporal Synchronizer** shall calculate the jitter variance to ensure stream continuity.

## 🎖️ Port 1: The Web Weaver (FUSE)
**Role**: Protocol Broker and Schema Harmonizer
  As the **Web Weaver**,
  I want to fuse disparate media signals into a standardized interaction schema
  So that tool interactions are decoupled from specific hardware drivers.

**Scenario**: Cross-Language Protocol Fusion
  Given the **Schema Harmonizer** is preparing the common message envelope
  And the **Protocol Broker** is bridging the gap between Python telemetry and TypeScript events
  When a fusion request is received for the W3C Pointer interface conversion
  Then the **Schema Harmonizer** shall apply the shared JSON schema to the payload
  And the **Protocol Broker** shall instantiate the transport daemon to relay the coordinate transformation.

## 🎖️ Port 2: The Mirror Magus (SHAPE)
**Role**: Digital Twin and Morphic Identity
  As the **Mirror Magus**,
  I want to shape a virtualized physics cursor as a digital twin
  So that tool interactions behave predictably within the virtual manifold.

**Scenario**: Virtual Cursor Morphogenesis
  Given the **Digital Twin Host** is maintaining the cursor entity's virtual coordinates
  And the **Morphic Modeler** is calculating the cursor's interaction radius and collision bounds
  When a movement signal is processed by the manifold logic
  Then the **Digital Twin Host** shall update the virtual transform without triggering OS-level mouse locks
  And the **Morphic Modeler** shall adapt the cursor's visual and physical representation based on the target element's hit-box.

## 🎖️ Port 3: The Spore Storm (DELIVER)
**Role**: Event Propagator and Latency Negotiator
  As the **Spore Storm**,
  I want to deliver W3C Pointer events with sub-millisecond precision
  So that the virtualized tool manifold achieves near-zero latency interaction.

**Scenario**: High-Resolution Event Dispatch
  Given the **Event Dispatcher** is managing the granular DOM event lifecycle (TS)
  And the **Injection Engine** is preparing the high-frequency packet burst
  When a state change is finalized in the physics manifold
  Then the **Event Dispatcher** shall convert physics coordinates into standardized PointerEvent objects
  And the **Injection Engine** shall emit the events into the target tool's event-loop with sub-millisecond dispatch logic.

## 🎖️ Port 4: The Red Regnant (DISRUPT)
**Role**: Constraint Enforcer and System Eraser
  As the **Red Regnant**,
  I want to disrupt native hardware interrupts and silence physical device noise
  So that the system relies solely on the virtualized tool chain.

**Scenario**: Hardware Signal Neutralization
  Given the **Signal Eraser** is identifying physical input device interrupts
  And the **Constraint Enforcer** is blocking non-virtualized interaction attempts
  When a physical mouse or keyboard event attempts to pollute the manifold state
  Then the **Signal Eraser** shall intercept and negate the physical interrupt
  And the **Constraint Enforcer** shall override the OS event-loop to prioritize the virtualized signal chain.

## 🎖️ Port 5: The Pyre Praetorian (DEFEND)
**Role**: State Guardian and Assertion Engine
  As the **Pyre Praetorian**,
  I want to verify the invariant state of the virtual cursor
  So that pointer drift and architectural "theater" are eliminated.

**Scenario**: Deterministic State Verification (TDD/CDD)
  Given the **State Guardian** is monitoring the cursor's ground-truth coordinates
  And the **Assertion Engine** is executing continuous health checks on the pointer manifold
  When the virtual state deviates from the mathematically predicted trajectory
  Then the **Assertion Engine** shall trigger a state-violation warning in the logs
  And the **State Guardian** shall force a re-alignment to the last known-good validated state.

---

## 🎖️ Port 6: The Kraken Keeper (STORE)
**Role**: Analytical Historian and Persistence Engine
  As the **Kraken Keeper**,
  I want to assimilate 1000Hz interaction streams into deep analytical storage
  So that the history of virtual tools can be replayed with absolute fidelity.

**Scenario**: Full-Fidelity Interaction Logging
  Given the **Analytical Historian** is managing the interaction schema in the data-lake (DuckDB)
  And the **Persistence Engine** is buffering high-velocity telemetry writes
  When a session of tool interaction is executed in the manifold
  Then the **Persistence Engine** shall stream the raw telemetry into a compressed JSONL format
  And the **Analytical Historian** shall index the events for sub-second retrieval and playback analysis.

## 🎖️ Port 7: The Spider Sovereign (NAVIGATE)
**Role**: Context Orchestrator and Domain Navigator
  As the **Spider Sovereign**,
  I want to navigate the virtual physics cursor across a mosaic of software domains
  So that the Hive maintains total command over the virtualized tool manifold.

**Scenario**: Cross-Domain Interaction Routing
  Given the **Context Orchestrator** is tracking the active application window and tool domain
  And the **Domain Navigator** is routing pointer events across tool boundaries
  When the user's intent requires shifting from a Python-backed analysis tool to a TypeScript-backed editor
  Then the **Context Orchestrator** shall swap the tool-context metadata in the manifold
  And the **Domain Navigator** shall ensure the W3C Pointer events are seamlessly rerouted to the new domain's event-loop.
