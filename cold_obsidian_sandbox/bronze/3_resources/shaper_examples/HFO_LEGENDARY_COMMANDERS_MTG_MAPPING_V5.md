# 🕸️ HFO Gen 88: MTG Semiotic Anchoring Report (Version 5)
## Declarative Gherkin & Software Mission Engineering

> **Status**: SEMIOTICALLY ANCHORED (PULSE/8)
> **Revision**: Gen 88 (V5)
> **Note**: This version translates the Dual-Anchor compositions into **Literate Declarative Gherkin**. It bridges the gap between MTG conceptual incarnations and the functional requirements of Software Mission Engineering in a JADC2 Mosaic Warfare context.

## 🎖️ Port 2: Mirror Magus (SHAPE)
**Feature**: Morphological Plasticity and Digital Twins
  As the **Mirror Magus**,

  When a validation target is identified in the manifold
  Then **Sakashima** shall allow the creation of a non-colliding digital twin
  And **Orvar** shall shape an identical instance in response to the target signal.

## 🎖️ Port 3: Spore Storm (DELIVER)
**Feature**: Granular Payload Delivery and Evolutionary Loops
  As the **Spore Storm**,
  I want to deliver modular payloads across the evolutionary lifecycle
  So that the swarm agents achieve maximum kinetic velocity.

**Scenario**: Dynamic Swarm Payload Delivery
  Given the **[Ghave](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Ghave%2C%20Guru%20of%20Spores%22)** main anchor is managing the circular decomposition of resources
  And the **[Locust God](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22The%20Locust%20God%22)** secondary anchor is poised for aerial deployment
  When a data-draw event triggers a delivery pulse
  Then **Ghave** shall convert logic counters into swarm agents
  And **The Locust God** shall deliver those agents with high-velocity kinetic impact.

## 🎖️ Port 4: Red Regnant (DISRUPT)
**Feature**: Hard-Gated Enforcement and Predatory Disruption
  As the **Red Regnant**,
  I want to silence external disruptions and capture lost environmental assets
  So that the cleanroom environment remains asymmetric and dominant.

**Scenario**: Asymmetric Environmental Clearing (The Scream)
  Given the **[Elesh Norn](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Elesh%20Norn%2C%20Mother%20of%20Machines%22)** main anchor is silencing external trigger resonance
  And the **[Tergrid](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Tergrid%2C%20God%20of%20Fright%22)** secondary anchor is monitoring environmental losses
  When a foreign entity attempts an unauthorized execution
  Then **Elesh Norn** shall negate the execution signal
  And **Tergrid** shall integrate the resulting entropy into the swarm's internal manifold.

## 🎖️ Port 5: Pyre Praetorian (DEFEND)
**Feature**: Immutable Immunization and Active Rebirth
  As the **Pyre Praetorian**,
  I want to provide baseline defense and iterative recovery loops
  So that the swarm survives total resource purges.

**Scenario**: Active Defense and Logical Rebirth
  Given the **[Syrix](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Syrix%2C%20Carrier%20of%20the%20Flame%22)** main anchor is monitoring the pyre of deleted assets
  And the **[Avacyn](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Avacyn%2C%20Angel%20of%20Hope%22)** secondary anchor is granting static invariance
  When a critical system component is purged from the cleanroom
  Then **Avacyn** shall attempt to negate the destruction signal
  And **Syrix** shall re-emerge from the logs to restore the component.

## 🎖️ Port 6: Kraken Keeper (STORE)
**Feature**: Deep Latency Storage and Active Energy Batteries
  As the **Kraken Keeper**,
  I want to store potential energy and maintain logic persistence
  So that the swarm survives long execution latencies.
