## 📜 Philosophical Alignment: Conceptual Incarnation
The HFO Gen 88 architecture does not suffer from "Vendor Lock-in" to single cards. Instead, these MTG references serve as a **Composition of Semantic Ideas**.

- **Non-Binary Mapping**: A commander is not *just* Syrix; they are the *intersection* of Syrix's rebirth, Avacyn's shield, and the Abolisher's silence.
- **Conceptual Incarnation**: By anchoring abstract JADC2 functions in the "Semantic Manifold" of MTG, we provide a concrete interface for AI agents to grasp the "Soul" of the Commander.
- **Mosaic Orchestration**: Like the cards in a deck, the Commanders arecomposable modules. Their identity is the **Synergy** of their options, not the average.

**Final Approval (Syrix)**: The selection of [Syrix, Carrier of the Flame](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Syrix%2C%20Carrier%20of%20the%20Flame%22) provides the necessary "Pyre" element to the praetorian—transforming them from a static gate into a living, recurring enforcement daemon.
