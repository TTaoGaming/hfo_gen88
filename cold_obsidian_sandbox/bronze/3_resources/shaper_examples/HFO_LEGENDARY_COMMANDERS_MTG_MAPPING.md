## 🎖️ Commander 0: Lidless Legion
**JADC2 Verb**: `SENSE` (The Hunt)
**Mosaic Role**: Strategic ISR, signal intelligence, and predictive forensics.

| Card Option | Strategic Alignment | Tradeoff |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Sauron, the Lidless Eye](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Sauron%2C%20the%20Lidless%20Eye%22)** | Literal flavor match. Provides haste and temporary control of assets (Sensing as a pre-cursor to capture). | High "AI Theater" flavor. Mechanics are aggressive rather than investigative. |
| **[Thrasios, Triton Hero](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Thrasios%2C%20Triton%20Hero%22)** | Competitive gold standard for "Sensing" resources. Continuously scries and develops land/knowledge. | Low flavor connection to a "Legion". Purely mechanical efficiency. |
| **[Meddling Mage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Meddling%20Mage%22)** | Forensic "Sensing" of the opponent's intentions. Names a threat before it manifests. | Fragile. Represents tactical sensing rather than strategic overwatch. |

**Selection Recommendation**: **[Thrasios](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Thrasios%2C%20Triton%20Hero%22)** for pure JADC2 efficiency; **[Sauron](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Sauron%2C%20the%20Lidless%20Eye%22)** for Gen 88 branding.

## 🎭 The Integrity Warning
Mapping these commanders to MTG cards carries a risk of **"AI Theater" (Score >99%)**. Do not assume a 1-to-1 parity. The HFO Commanders are functions; MTG cards are instances. 

**Run health check**: `npx tsx hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/2_areas/hfo_ports/P4_RED_REGNANT/RED_REGNANT.ts` to ensure semiotic drift has not corrupted the medallion logic.
