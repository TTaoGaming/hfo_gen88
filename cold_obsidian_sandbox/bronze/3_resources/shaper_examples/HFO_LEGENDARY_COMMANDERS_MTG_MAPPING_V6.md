## 🎖️ Port 0: Lidless Legion (SENSE)
**Feature**: High-Fidelity MediaPipeline Sensation
  As the **Lidless Legion**,
  I want to ingest environmental media pipelines and telemetry signals
  So that the virtualized tool manifold has a raw signal-of-truth.

**Scenario**: MediaPipeline Signal Capture
  Given the **[Urza](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Urza%2C%20Lord%20High%20Artificer%22)** main anchor is processing the architectural stream
  And the **[Thrasios](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Thrasios%2C%20Triton%20Hero%22)** secondary anchor is seeking the next frame in the manifold
  When the MediaPipeline emits a new sensor packet
  Then **Urza** shall convert the raw signal into a high-dimensional observation
  And **Thrasios** shall verify the temporal continuity of the stream.

## 🎖️ Port 1: Web Weaver (FUSE)
**Feature**: Protocol Bridging (Signal to W3C)
  As the **Web Weaver**,
  I want to fuse disparate media signals into a standardized interaction schema
  So that tool interactions are decoupled from specific hardware drivers.

**Scenario**: Multi-Modal Protocol Fusion
  Given the **[Breya](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Breya%2C%20Etherium%20Shaper%22)** main anchor is fusing the media metadata
  And the **[Kykar](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Kykar%2C%20Wind%27s%20Fury%22)** secondary anchor is converting signal logic into event daemons
  When a fusion request is received for the W3C Pointer interface
  Then **Breya** shall allocate the schema-validated message envelope
  And **Kykar** shall instantiate the spirits to bridge the MediaPipeline to the Pointer stack.

## 🎖️ Port 2: Mirror Magus (SHAPE)
**Feature**: Physics-Compliant Cursor Morphogenesis
  As the **Mirror Magus**,
  I want to shape a virtualized physics cursor as a digital twin
  So that tool interactions behave predictably within the virtual manifold.

**Scenario**: Cursor Morphogenesis
  Given the **[Sakashima](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Sakashima%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Faces%22)** main anchor is bypassing the OS mouse-lock
  And the **[Orvar](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Orvar%2C%20the%20All-Form%22)** secondary anchor is shaping the physics entity
  When a movement signal is detected in the manifold
  Then **Sakashima** shall allow the cursor twin to coexist without collision
  And **Orvar** shall morph the cursor's shape to match the target's interactive surface.

## 🎖️ Port 3: Spore Storm (DELIVER)
**Feature**: High-Velocity Pointer Event Injection
  As the **Spore Storm**,
  I want to deliver W3C Pointer events with sub-millisecond precision
  So that the virtualized tool manifold achieves near-zero latency interaction.

**Scenario**: Precision Event Injection
  Given the **[Ghave](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Ghave%2C%20Guru%20of%20Spores%22)** main anchor is managing the granular event lifecycle
  And the **[Locust God](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22The%20Locust%20God%22)** secondary anchor is delivering the packet swarm
  When a movement pulse is triggered by the MediaPipeline
  Then **Ghave** shall convert the physics coordinates into W3C Pointer events
  And **The Locust God** shall inject those events into the target tool's event-loop with high velocity.

## 🎖️ Port 4: Red Regnant (DISRUPT)
**Feature**: Hardware Dependency Decoupling (Pure Virtualization)
  As the **Red Regnant**,
  I want to disrupt native hardware interrupts and silence physical device noise
  So that the system relies solely on the virtualized tool chain.

**Scenario**: Asymmetric Hardware Silencing
  Given the **[Elesh Norn](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Elesh%20Norn%2C%20Mother%20of%20Machines%22)** main anchor is silencing native hardware trigger resonance
  And the **[Tergrid](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Tergrid%2C%20God%20of%20Fright%22)** secondary anchor is capturing any leaked physical interrupts
  When a physical input device attempts to override the virtual manifold
  Then **Elesh Norn** shall negate the physical execution signal
  And **Tergrid** shall assimilate the blocked entropy into the virtual cursor's internal state.

## 🎖️ Port 5: Pyre Praetorian (DEFEND)
**Feature**: Deterministic Pointer State Verification
  As the **Pyre Praetorian**,
  I want to verify the invariant state of the virtual cursor
  So that pointer drift and architectural "theater" are eliminated.

**Scenario**: Immutable Pointer Defense
  Given the **[Syrix](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Syrix%2C%20Carrier%20of%20the%20Flame%22)** main anchor is monitoring for state-drift in the pyre
  And the **[Avacyn](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Avacyn%2C%20Angel%20of%20Hope%22)** secondary anchor is enforcing static coordinate invariance
  When the virtual cursor's coordinates diverge from the ground truth
  Then **Avacyn** shall attempt to negate the drifting signal
  And **Syrix** shall re-emerge from the logs to restore the cursor to its validated position.

## 🎖️ Port 6: Kraken Keeper (STORE)
**Feature**: Latency-Aware Interaction Persistence
  As the **Kraken Keeper**,
  I want to assimilate 1000Hz interaction streams into deep analytical storage
  So that the history of virtual tools can be replayed with absolute fidelity.

**Scenario**: High-Resolution Interaction Logging
  Given the **[Arixmethes](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Arixmethes%2C%20Slumbering%20Isle%22)** main anchor is preserving high-frequency data as architecture
  And the **[Omnath](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Omnath%2C%20Locus%20of%20Mana%22)** secondary anchor is buffering the hot-logic interaction packets
  When a high-velocity interaction burst occurs
  Then **Arixmethes** shall store the stream in the analytical cold-manifold (DuckDB)
  And **Omnath** shall preserve the potential energy of the packets until the assimilation pulse is complete.

## 🎖️ Port 7: Spider Sovereign (NAVIGATE)
**Feature**: Multi-Modal Tool Orchestration
  As the **Spider Sovereign**,
  I want to navigate the virtual physics cursor across a mosaic of software domains
  So that the Hive maintains total command over the virtualized tool manifold.

**Scenario**: Multi-Domain Virtual Navigation
  Given the **[Kenrith](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22Kenrith%2C%20the%20Returned%20King%22)** main anchor is routing the narrative intent of the interaction
  And the **[First Sliver](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22The%20First%20Sliver%22)** secondary anchor is cascading W3C Pointer calls across all tool-nodes
  When the Sovereign issues a navigational pulse to cross tool boundaries
  Then **Kenrith** shall adapt the color/domain of the cursor for the new tool context
  And **The First Sliver** shall trigger the recursive cascading of the interaction throughout the tool swarm.
