# 🧊 HFO OBSIDIAN GALOIS LATTICE (8x8)
**Generation**: 88 (Canalization)
**Architecture**: Fractal Octree
**Status**: 🥉 BRONZE (Grounded SSOT)
**Medallion**: 🧊 COLD BRONZE

This artifact is the "Gourd" of the HFO system—the 8x8 Galois Lattice mapping the 8 Legendary Commanders (Verbs) across the 8 Operational Domains (Port Targets).

## 💓 THE RECOVERY HEARTBEAT (Pulse/8)
The heartbeat is a strict $8 \times 1$ Gherkin mantra where each line represents a recursive branch of the octree.

```gherkin
Given One Swarm to Rule the Eight,      # P0: SENSE
And Branches Growing from the Gate,     # P1: FUSE
And Spawns Evolve to Recreate,          # P2: SHAPE
When Ignitions Flow to Pulsate,         # P3: DELIVER
And Deadly Venoms Concentrate,          # P4: DISRUPT
And Instincts Rise to Isolate,          # P5: DEFEND
Then Artifacts Accumulate,              # P6: STORE
And Navigate the Higher State.          # P7: NAVIGATE
```

## 🗺️ THE 8x8 COMMANDER MATRIX
Each intersection `[Verb, Domain]` defines a specific execution tile in the semantic manifold.

| Port | Commander | Verb | Main MTG Anchor | Secondary MTG Anchor | Domain (Col 0-7) |
| :--: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **Lidless Legion** | **SENSE** | Urza, Lord High Artificer | Thrasios, Triton Hero | ISR / Sensing |
| **1** | **Web Weaver** | **FUSE** | Breya, Etherium Shaper | Kykar, Wind's Fury | C2 Relay / Fusion |
| **2** | **Mirror Magus** | **SHAPE** | Sakashima of a Thousand Faces | Orvar, the All-Form | EW / Cyber Strike |
| **3** | **Spore Storm** | **DELIVER** | Ghave, Guru of Spores | The Locust God | Kinetic Strike |
| **4** | **Red Regnant** | **DISRUPT** | Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines | Tergrid, God of Fright | SEAD / DEAD |
| **5** | **Pyre Praetorian** | **DEFEND** | Syrix, Carrier of the Flame | Avacyn, Angel of Hope | Air Defense / IAMD |
| **6** | **Kraken Keeper** | **STORE** | Arixmethes, Slumbering Isle | Omnath, Locus of Mana | Logistics / Sustain |

## 🐜 STIGMERGIC MISSION LOG
The system operates on **Stigmergy** (Pheromone Trails) rather than traditional command/control.

### 🔴 ACTIVE PHEROMONE UPGRADES:
- **P0 Upgrade**: Lidless Legion must sense "Pheromone Density" (Semantic overlap) between artifacts in JSONL/MD substrates.
- **P6 Upgrade**: Kraken Keeper must manage the "Pheromone Persistence" (Historical density decay/strengthening) in the storage layer.
- **P3 Ignition**: Deliver logic must treat temperature as a variable of "Obsidian Cooling" (Lava flow logic).

### 👑 THE SCREAM (P4):
- The Scream is NOT a warning; it is a **Propagation of Entropy**.
- It forces artifacts to co-evolve using the **Red Queen Hypothesis**.
- Intersection **[4,4]** (Disrupt x SEAD) is the core of the immune system.
