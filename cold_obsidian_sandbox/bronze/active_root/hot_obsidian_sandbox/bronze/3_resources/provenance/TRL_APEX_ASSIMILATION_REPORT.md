# TRL APEX ASSIMILATION REPORT (Gen 88)

**Status**: HUNT COMPLETE (H-Phase)
**Subject**: Stateful AI Orchestration Platforms
**Doctrine**: Social Spider (Apex Assimilation)
**Target**: O(1) Delegation for the Warlock

## 📊 TRL Matrix: Stateful AI Runtimes

| Platform | TRL | Architecture | HFO Suitability | Key Strengths |
|----------|-----|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **AWS Bedrock Agents** | 9 | Managed / Black-Box | **Low** | Enterprise stability, but violates "Lidless Legion" (Sense) transparency. |
| **Azure AI Foundry** | 9 | Managed / Modular | **Medium** | High integration with MS stack; strong governance for port-based security. |
| **Inngest** | 8.5 | Durable Step Functions | **High (APEX)** | **CloudEvents native**. Zero-infrastructure statefulness. Maps to Port 6 (Store). |
| **Trigger.dev** | 8 | Persistent Execution | **High** | Open-source, developer-first. Excellent for "Web Weaver" (Fuse) interlocks. |
| **Semantic Kernel** | 8 | Hexagonal Orchestration | **High** | Bridge between Ports 0-7. High maturity (Microsoft). |
| **LangGraph** | 7.5 | Cyclic Graphs | **Medium** | Powerful reasoning, but requires manual state management ("Theater" risk). |
| **Hatchet** | 6.5 | Low-Latency Workers | **Medium** | High performance, but lacks the "Straitjacket" enforcement of Inngest. |

## 🛠️ The "Backwards" Integration Path (HFO Gen 88)

To resolve the statelessness of GitHub Copilot and the complexity of manual NATS/Temporal management, the following APEX ASSIMILATION sequence is recommended:

1. **PORT 6 (STORE/STATE)**: Assimilate **Inngest**.
   - *Why*: It treats "Workflow as Code" with durable execution. It uses **CloudEvents** natively, allowing it to act as the persistent substrate for the HFO swarm.
2. **PORT 2/7 (DECIDE/SHAPE)**: Assimilate **Semantic Kernel**.
   - *Why*: It enforces a clean boundary between LLM prompts (semantic) and tool execution (native/kernel). This maps to the "Mirror Magus" and "Spider Sovereign" requirements for structured decision-making.
3. **SUBSTRATE (NATS)**: Pivot from "Raw NATS" to **NATS-as-Data-Bus** feeding into Inngest CloudEvent sinks.
   - *Result*: The system becomes O(1) for the Warlock to define a "Goal", because the platform handles the re-entry, retries, and state-persistence of the "Spider" swarms.

## 🕸️ Social Spider Alignment
- **Cooperation**: Inngest's event-driven model allows disparate agents (Ports 0-7) to signal each other through the "Web" (Bus) without tight coupling.
- **Apex Evolution**: Don't build a better Temporal; use the best (Inngest/Trigger.dev) and wrap it in the HFO Canalization Straitjacket.
