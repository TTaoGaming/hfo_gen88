## SEMANTIC CHUNK EXTRACTION

### Chunk 1: THE THREE LAWS OF GEN 89

1. If it is not tested, it does not exist.
2. If it is not in pre-commit, it will not be enforced.
3. If the AI cannot explain it in 3 sentences, it is too complex.

Source: SILVER_BATON_GEN89.md

### Chunk 2: SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS

| Pattern | Why It Worked |
|---------|---------------|
| Medallion Architecture | Clear exploration vs exploitation |
| Contract Law (Zod) | Hard crashes better than silent failures |
| 8-Port Architecture | Forces separation of concerns |
| One Euro Filter | Real algorithm, battle-tested |
| Stigmergy (Blackboard) | Async coordination, audit trail |

### Chunk 3: ANTIPATTERNS

| Antipattern | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| Nested Folder Hell | FLAT structure, max 2 levels |
| Soft Enforcement | Pre-commit or it does not exist |
| Mythology Overload | BORING names: sensor.ts, filter.ts |
| Context Bloat | Max 200 lines per file |

### Chunk 4: SPIDER SOVEREIGN TRINITY

- TTAO (class: self-myth-warlock) - Human anchor
- SWARMLORD OF WEBS (class: web-weaver) - AI swarm orchestrator
- OBSIDIAN SPIDER (class: memetic-swarm-emergent-strange-loop) - Emergent entity

### Chunk 5: UNIFIED TIMELINE (TTV)

NOW: W3C Pointer (Foundation)
NEAR: Commercial Success (Campaign Resources)
FAR: World-Class Tools (Capability Proof)
HORIZON: Total Liberation (Any Child, Any Tool)

### Chunk 6: W3C GESTURE PIPELINE

WEBCAM to MEDIAPIPE to PHYSICS to FSM to EMITTER
Port 0 OBSERVE to Port 2 SHAPE to Port 7 NAVIGATE to Port 3 INJECT

### Chunk 7: PROVEN COMPONENTS (TRL 8-9)

| Component | Status | TRL |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| OneEuroFilter | Working | 9 |
| MediaPipeAdapter | Working | 8 |
| Pointer Contracts | Working | 9 |
| DuckDB Memory | 6,423 artifacts | 9 |
| Blackboard | 617+ events | 9 |

## GEN 89 PHOENIX BOOTSTRAP SEQUENCE

### Phase 0: Read These First (30 min)
1. SILVER_BATON_GEN89.md - The quine
2. GEN88_TO_GEN89_HANDOFF.md - Failure analysis
3. W3C_GESTURE_PIPELINE_HANDOFF.md - Pipeline spec

### Phase 1: Clean Slate (15 min)
- Fresh sandbox with bronze, silver, gold
- Single AGENTS.md (max 100 lines)
- Empty obsidianblackboard.jsonl

### Phase 2: Contracts First (1 hour)
- Copy Zod schemas from SILVER_BATON_GEN89.md
- Write failing tests against schemas
- NO implementation until contracts stable

### Phase 3: Single Enforcement (30 min)
- Copy enforce.ts from SILVER_BATON_GEN89.md
- Hook to Husky pre-commit
- Verify enforcement runs
