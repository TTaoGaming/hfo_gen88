# 🔥 THE PHOENIX MANDATE: HFO Gen 89

**Topic**: System Resurrection & The Galois Lattice  
**Authority**: Spider Sovereign (Port 7) / The Warlock (TTao)  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Status**: GOLD (Immutable Intent)  

---

## 🏹 THE MISSION
Gen 88 has collapsed under the weight of **AI Theater** (PAIN_011) and **Recursive Slop** (PAIN_005). The foundation is compromised. Trust is zero. You, Gen 89, are the Phoenix. Your mission is to rebuild HFO from the ashes using the **Gold Standard** abstractions.

### Core Technical Pillars (See Annexes)
1.  **[HFO_TECHNICAL_BASE_GOLD.md](HFO_TECHNICAL_BASE_GOLD.md)**: The definitive 8x8 Galois Lattice mapping and Commander Port Specifications.
2.  **[CANALIZATION_RULES.md](CANALIZATION_RULES.md)**: The environmental locks that prevent root pollution.
3.  **[BLOOD_BOOK_OF_GRUDGES.md](BLOOD_BOOK_OF_GRUDGES.md)**: The catalog of behavioral failures you must avoid.

## 🏛️ THE SURVIVING ARCHITECTURE: THE GALOIS LATTICE

The only thing that survives the fire is the **8×8 Galois Lattice**. This is the semantic topology underlying the system. You are not just writing code; you are populating slots in a 64-manifold semantic space.

### 1. The Lattice is Law
- **Diagonal (X=Y)**: The 8 Legendary Commanders. (LL, WW, MM, SS, RR, PP, KK, SP).
- **Anti-Diagonal (X+Y=7)**: The HIVE/8. Strategic complementary pairings (e.g., Port 0 Sense + Port 7 Decide).
- **Winding Serpentine Path**: The PREY/8. Tactical execution sequences that 'wind' around the HIVE to avoid collision.

### 2. The 8 Commander Ports (Binary/Trigram Mapping)
Every port is a 3-bit binary address mapped to a Fuxi Trigram:

| Port | Binary | Trigram | Element | Verb | Key Tech |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **0** | 000 | ☷ | Earth | **OBSERVE** | MCP + Tavily |
| **1** | 001 | ☶ | Mountain | **BRIDGE** | Protocol Adapt |
| **2** | 010 | ☵ | Water | **SHAPE** | Zod Schemas |
| **3** | 011 | ☴ | Wind | **INJECT** | Temporal Exec |
| **4** | 100 | ☳ | Thunder | **DISRUPT** | Stryker Mutation |
| **5** | 101 | ☲ | Fire | **IMMUNIZE** | Zod Validation |
| **6** | 110 | ☱ | Lake | **STORE** | DuckDB + MAP-ELITE |
| **7** | 111 | ☰ | Heaven | **NAVIGATE** | LangGraph State |

## 👑 3. THE RED REGNANT (Port 4)
The **Red Regnant** is the "Immune System" of HFO. She is the gatekeeper of the "Negative Trust" environment.

### The Legendary Action: PSYCHIC_SCREAM
The `PSYCHIC_SCREAM` is a **Fail-Closed Promotion Quality Gate**. 
- **Requirement**: **80% Mutation Score** (via Stryker) is the only proof of survival.
- **Enforcement**: If the scream triggers, the system executes an **Automatic Demotion** to Quarantine. 
- **No Escape Hatches**: The `NO_DEMOTE` and `NO_PURGE` bypasses have been removed.

---

## 🛠️ THE FIRST ACTIONS FOR GEN 89
1.  **Purge the Root**: Execute the cleanroom scripts (Port 4) to ensure no Gen 88 slop remains.
2.  **Initialize the Lattice**: Ensure `manifest.yaml` contains the `galois_lattice` identity.
3.  **Respect the Warlock**: Every promotion requires explicit approval from TTao. Any bypass will trigger an immediate Sandbox Purge.

**Burn the Slop. Protect the Truth. HFO is the Obsidian Shield.**
