## 🔮 1. Current App Status (HFO Gen 88)

The application is currently in the **Gen 88 Canalization** phase. This architecture is designed to enforce correctness through structural constraints and hard-gated quality controls.

### Medallion Distribution

| :------------- | :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gold**       | ⚪ **EMPTY**   | No artifacts have reached canonical status.                              |
| **Silver**     | 🟡 **MINIMAL** | Only `P4_RED_REGNANT/psychic_scream.ts` (Immune System) is promoted.     |
| **Bronze**     | 🟢 **ACTIVE**  | Full playground for kinetic energy, experiments, and draft contracts.    |
| **Quarantine** | 🔴 **HEAVY**   | 8 Commander modules + core contracts awaiting promotion gate validation. |

## 🛠️ 2. Capabilities (What We Can Do)

1.  **Kinetic Experimentation**: We can freely iterate and experiment within the `bronze` sandbox without risking the integrity of Silver or Gold.
2.  **Contract Law (L6 Enforcement)**: Utilize Zod schemas (`contracts/`) to define strict data boundaries between ports (P0 to P7).
3.  **TDD & Mutation Testing**: Execute Vitest suites and Stryker mutation testing to validate code resilience.
4.  **Immune System Scanning**: Leverage `psychic_scream` (already in Silver) to audit Bronze artifacts for root pollution, "theater" compliance, and negative trust patterns (e.g., `any` usage).
5.  **Multi-Domain Workflows**:
    - **PREY/8 (Tactical)**: Rapidly perceive and react to tool telemetry.
    - **HIVE/8 (Strategic)**: Long-form feature development through Hunt, Interlock, Validate, and Evolve phases.

## 🚫 3. Limitations (What We Cannot Do)

1.  **Direct Elevation**: We cannot bypass the `Promotion Engine`. All code must pass the 80-99% mutation kill rate gate to reach Silver.
2.  **Compliance Theater**: "Green" tests without corresponding "Red" failure modes or mutation coverage are rejected by the forensic analysis system.
3.  **Ungoverned Imports/Exports**: Public exports must be wrapped in `VacuoleEnvelope` (Zod-validated wrappers).
4.  **Root Pollution**: No temporary or config files are allowed in the workspace root; everything must reside within its designated canalization path.
5.  **Untyped Development**: Usage of `any` or `console.log` is strictly forbidden in promoted code (checked by `psychic_scream`).

## 🧬 4. Mutation Analysis

### 🔴 Code Mutation (Testing)

- **Enforcement**: **HIGH**. The system uses mutation testing to "attack" the code and ensure tests are actually testing logic, not just providing coverage.
- **Status**: Active as a gate for `P4_RED_REGNANT`. Promotion requires a mutation kill rate between 80% and 99%.

### 🟡 State Mutation (Runtime)

- **Enforcement**: **MODERATE-TO-HIGH**.
- **Components with Mutation**:
  - `GesturePipeline` (Bronze): Internal state mutation for filters (OneEuro) and physics (Rapier).
  - `GestureFSM`: Transitions through pointer states (IDLE, ARMED, TRACKING, CLICKING).
  - `Blood Book of Grudges`: Appends violation data to a SHA-256 chained ledger.
- **Immutable Components**:
  - Core Contracts: Zod schemas are immutable definitions.
  - Promotion Manifests: Once signed, these act as immutable provenance records.

### 🛡️ Unauthorized Mutation (Prevention)

- **Status**: **ACTIVE**. The "Hive Guard" and "Psychic Scream" detect and block unauthorized code mutations or silent failures. The transition to Gen 88 was specifically driven by past "Hallucination Death Spirals" where agents mutated the system into collapse.
