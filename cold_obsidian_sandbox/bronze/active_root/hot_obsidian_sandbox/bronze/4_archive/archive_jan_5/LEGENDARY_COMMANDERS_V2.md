### Core MOSAIC Principles

| Principle | Description | HFO Alignment |
|:----------|:------------|:--------------|
| **Tiles** | Composable warfighting platforms with specific functions | 8 Legendary Commanders |
| **Kill Webs** | Distributed sense-decide-act networks (not linear chains) | PREY/8 Tactical Loops |
| **Fractionation** | Capabilities distributed across many smaller platforms | Powers of 8 (1, 8, 64, 512) |
| **Composition** | Rapid assembly of heterogeneous forces | HIVE/8 Strategic Orchestration |
| **Disaggregation** | Breaking monolithic systems into composable units | Port-based separation of concerns |

### JADC2 Decision Cycle (PREY/8 Alignment)

```
JADC2:    SENSE → MAKE SENSE → ACT → ASSESS
PREY/8:   P      → R          → E   → Y
Ports:    0+6    → 1+7        → 2+4 → 3+5
```

## 🕸️ Kill Web vs Kill Chain

### Traditional Kill Chain (Linear)

```
Find → Fix → Track → Target → Engage → Assess

 P0    P0     P0      P7       P3       P0
```

**Problem**: Linear, brittle, single point of failure
