# 🧶 LATTICE ALIGNMENT REPORT — [BRONZE_STASIS | HYPER_FRACTAL]

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-05T19:27:11-07:00  
**Status**: ALIGNMENT AUDIT  
**Keywords**: `BRONZE_STASIS`, `HYPER_FRACTAL`

## 🎯 Audit Scope

This report evaluates the alignment of the current **HFO Gen 88** implementation against the canonical **8x8 Galois Lattice** as defined in the Port 7 artifact: [OBSIDIAN_HOURGLASS.md](file:///c:/Dev/active/hfo_gen88/hot_obsidian_sandbox/bronze/P7_SPIDER_SOVEREIGN/OBSIDIAN_HOURGLASS.md).

---

## ✅ Points of Alignment

### 1. The 8-Port Commander Core

The system remains strictly aligned with the 8 Legendary Commanders (Ports 0-7) and their associated JADC2/HFO verbs.

- **P0** (Lidless Legion/Observe) ↔ **P7** (Spider Sovereign/Navigate)
- **P1** (Web Weaver/Bridge) ↔ **P6** (Kraken Keeper/Assimilate)
- **P2** (Mirror Magus/Shape) ↔ **P5** (Pyre Praetorian/Immunize)
- **P3** (Spore Storm/Inject) ↔ **P4** (Red Regnant/Disrupt)

### 2. Strategic HIVE/8 (Anti-Diagonal)

Current documentation accurately reflects the **X + Y = 7** anti-diagonal for HIVE strategic phases:

- **H (Hunt)**: 0 + 7
- **I (Interlock)**: 1 + 6
- **V (Validate)**: 2 + 5
- **E (Evolve)**: 3 + 4

### 3. Medallion Flow Enforcement

The Bronze/Silver separation is being strictly enforced by the Port 4 (Red Regnant) "Psychic Scream" mechanism, which is canonical for **Canalized Architectures**.

## ⚠️ Warning: Strategic Drift Detected

### 1. PREY/8 Serpentine Pattern Omission

There is significant **drift** in the awareness of the **PREY/8 Tactical Loop**.

- **Canonical Definition**: PREY follows a serpentine pattern winding around the HIVE anti-diagonal with unique port pairs:
  - **P (Perceive)**: 0 + 6
  - **R (React)**: 1 + 7
  - **E (Execute)**: 2 + 4
  - **Y (Yield)**: 3 + 5
- **Current Drift**: Recent status reports (including `STATE_OF_THE_SYSTEM_GEN88.md`) emphasize the HIVE anti-diagonal but neglect the serpentine PREY loop, potentially leading to "Tactical Blindness" where agents focus on the strategic phase without following the JADC2-driven tactical cycle.

### 2. Strange Loop Awareness

While the **Diagonal (X=Y)** is correctly identified as **Meta-Optimization**, the "Strange Loop" mechanic (Output of E feeding next H) is often treated as a linear progression rather than a recursive, bilateral flow. The **1010 Pattern** (Scatter/Gather) is present in documentation but lacks active runtime enforcement in current kinetic scripts.

---

## 🏮 Recommendation: "Turning the Hourglass"

To correct the drift, the system must re-initialize focus on the **Tactical PREY/8** pairs.

- **P0 + P6** (Sense + Memory) must be bridged better to ensure research (HUNT) yield is persistent.
- **P1 + P7** (Bridge + Decision) must be used to dynamically spawn sub-tasks within HIVE phases.
