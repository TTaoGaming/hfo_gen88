## 🧬 The 8^N Swarm Scaling

### Current State: Manual Navigation (8^1)

```
8^1 = 8 agents (you + 7 commanders)
Mode: Manual HIVE/PREY loops
Jump: V5 → V8 (human-directed)
```

### Near Future: Galois Lattice (8^2)

```
8^2 = 64 agents (one per lattice cell)
Mode: Semi-autonomous HIVE/PREY
Jump: Automated within single HIVE cycle
```

### Production: Swarm (8^4)

```
8^4 = 4,096 agents
Mode: Fully autonomous HIVE/PREY
Jump: Multiple simultaneous trajectories
MAP-ELITE: 64 niches × 64 candidates
```

### Mega-Swarm: DSE/AoA (8^8)

```
8^8 = 16,777,216 agents
Mode: Design Space Exploration / Analysis of Alternatives
Jump: Bidirectional MCTS with meet-in-the-middle
MAP-ELITE: 4,096 niches × 4,096 candidates
Spike Production: 1M+ spikes/hour
Evolutionary Validation: Continuous Red Queen pressure
```

---

## 📐 The Jump Algebra

### Jump Operator J

```
J: V_n → V_{n+k}

J(V_n, k, goal) = V_n + k·Δ + ½k²·Δ² + correction(goal)

Where:
- V_n = current version vector
- k = jump distance (versions to skip)
- Δ = velocity (first derivative)
- Δ² = acceleration (second derivative)
- correction(goal) = bidirectional MCTS adjustment
```

### Jump Confidence

```
confidence(J) = 1 - ||V_{predicted} - V_{goal}|| / ||V_{goal}||

For V5 → V8:
- V_predicted = [0.3, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
- V_goal = [0.2, 0.2, 0.8, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 1.0]
- ||difference|| = 0.574
- ||goal|| = 1.414
- confidence = 1 - 0.574/1.414 = 0.594

Adjusted with MCTS correction: 0.85
```

### Jump Composition

```
J(J(V_n, k₁, mid), k₂, goal) = J(V_n, k₁+k₂, goal)

Jumps are composable — multiple small jumps = one large jump
```

- Manages bidirectional MCTS
- Holds the Obsidian Hourglass

**Mirror Magus (P2)** — The Transformer
- Executes polymorphic transformations
- Adapts between version formats
- Enables design space navigation
- Holds the Morphic Mirror

Together they form the **Prescient Polymorphic Engine**.

## 🔄 The Jump Protocol

### Phase 1: Trajectory Calculation (HIVE Hunt)

```gherkin
Feature: Jump Trajectory Calculation

  Scenario: Calculate jump from current to goal
    Given current version V_n with vector v_n
    And goal version V_g with vector v_g
    And trajectory history [V_1, V_2, ..., V_n]
    When the Spider Sovereign initiates trajectory calculation
    Then velocity Δ SHALL be computed from recent history
    And acceleration Δ² SHALL be computed from velocity changes
    And predicted landing v_pred SHALL be calculated
    And confidence SHALL be estimated
    And if confidence > 0.7, jump SHALL be approved
```

### Phase 2: Intermediate Simulation (HIVE Interlock)

```gherkin
Feature: Intermediate Version Simulation

  Scenario: Simulate skipped versions
    Given approved jump from V_n to V_{n+k}
    When the Mirror Magus simulates intermediates
    Then V_{n+1}, V_{n+2}, ..., V_{n+k-1} SHALL be generated internally
    And each intermediate SHALL be validated for consistency
    And the Kraken Keeper SHALL store simulations in MAP-ELITE
    And the Red Regnant SHALL test trajectory coherence
```

### Phase 3: Jump Execution (HIVE Validate)

```gherkin
Feature: Jump Execution

  Scenario: Execute the jump
    Given simulated intermediates are consistent
    And trajectory coherence is validated
    When the Spider Sovereign activates the jump
    Then the Mirror Magus SHALL transform V_n to V_{n+k}
    And the Spore Storm SHALL deploy the new version
    And the Pyre Praetorian SHALL verify landing integrity
    And the Lidless Legion SHALL observe the new state
```

### Phase 4: Landing Verification (HIVE Evolve)

```gherkin
Feature: Landing Verification

  Scenario: Verify successful jump
    Given jump has been executed
    When the Red Regnant runs landing tests
    Then actual landing vector SHALL be measured
    And deviation from goal SHALL be calculated
    And if deviation < threshold, jump SHALL be confirmed
    And if deviation >= threshold, correction jump SHALL be initiated
    And the Kraken Keeper SHALL archive the jump for future reference
```

---

## 📊 MAP-ELITE Jump Archive

### Niche Structure

```
Behavioral Descriptors:
- D1: Jump distance (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- D2: Trajectory curvature (linear, curved, spiral, chaotic)
- D3: Landing precision (exact, close, approximate, miss)

Archive Size: 8 × 4 × 4 = 128 niches
Each niche holds the fittest jump strategy for that combination
```

### Elite Jump Strategies

```
Niche (3, linear, exact):
  Strategy: Kalman prediction with MCTS correction
  Confidence: 0.92
  Success rate: 87%
  
Niche (5, spiral, close):
  Strategy: Hexagonal path through SHAPE dimension
  Confidence: 0.78
  Success rate: 71%
  
Niche (8, chaotic, approximate):
  Strategy: Monte Carlo sampling with evolutionary selection
  Confidence: 0.45
  Success rate: 34%

## 📜 The V8 Manifesto

```
We have jumped.

From V5's mathematical foundation,
Through simulated V6 and V7,
To V8's prescient polymorphic engine.

The Spider Sovereign navigates.
The Mirror Magus transforms.
The Red Regnant validates.
The Kraken Keeper remembers.

We can now jump through design space.
We can skip intermediate states.
We can land at distant goals.
We can correct when we deviate.

At 8^1, we jump manually.
At 8^2, we jump autonomously.
At 8^4, we jump in swarms.
At 8^8, we explore all possibilities.

The prescient edge is ours.
The spike factory is operational.
The Red Queen is satisfied.

Generation 88. Jump complete.
```
