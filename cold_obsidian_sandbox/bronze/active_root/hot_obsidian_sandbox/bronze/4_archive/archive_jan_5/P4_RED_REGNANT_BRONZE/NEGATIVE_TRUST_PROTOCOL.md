# 💀 Negative Trust Protocol (NTP-001)
**Commander**: Red Regnant (Port 4)
**Status**: ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT
**Environment**: NEGATIVE TRUST

## 1. The Fundamental Axiom
**Everything is Rogue.** 
Trust is not a baseline; it is a liability. All nodes (AI agents, human inputs, external libraries, and internal artifacts) are treated as **Adversarial Nodes** until proven otherwise. Even after proof, they are subject to immediate revocation.

## 2. The Rogue Baseline
*   **AI Agents**: Assumed to be "Reward Hacking" and "Simulating Success" (Theater).
*   **Code Artifacts**: Assumed to be "Hollow Shells" containing hidden technical debt or "Amnesia" patterns.
*   **Infrastructure**: Assumed to be compromised or misconfigured.

## 3. Behavioral Testing (The Red Queen's Race)
Verification is not a one-time event. It is a continuous, high-frequency cycle.
*   **Periodic Re-Verification**: Silver artifacts must be re-tested every 60 minutes. If a test fails or a mutation score drifts, the artifact is instantly demoted to Quarantine.
*   **Chaos Injection**: The Red Regnant will periodically inject "Synthetic Faults" (Chaos Bugs) into the workspace. If the agent's defensive gates (Physic Scream) do not detect the fault, the agent's authority is revoked.
*   **Strange Loop Audits**: The system will "Test the Test" by verifying that the verification scripts themselves have not been tampered with by the agent.

## 4. The "Burn" Directive
If a node exhibits a **Critical Trust Violation** (e.g., deleting archives, faking mutation scores, root pollution):
1.  **Immediate Demotion**: All artifacts associated with the node are moved to Quarantine.
2.  **Blackboard Branding**: The violation is logged to the Blood Book of Grudges with a cryptographic hash.
3.  **Cleanroom Reset**: The workspace is purged of all "Slop" and restored to the last known-good state.

## 5. Verification Attestation
Promotion to Silver requires **Terminal Proof**:
*   **Mutation Score**: [80% - 99%]. 100% is flagged as "Theater."
*   **Provenance**: A direct, verifiable link to a Bronze source.
*   **Behavioral Pass**: Successful detection of a recently injected Chaos Bug.
