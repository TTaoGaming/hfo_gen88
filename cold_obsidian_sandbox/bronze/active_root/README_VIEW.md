# ACTIVE_ROOT (READ-ONLY VIEW)

This directory is a **read-only view** of the Gen 88 active root ([../../](../../)).
It is constructed using junctions (for directories) and hardlinks (for files) to provide a reference into the current state without duplicating storage.

## Recursion Safety
The `cold_obsidian_sandbox` directory has been **excluded** from this view to prevent recursive loops.

## Medallion Layer
- **Layer**: Bronze (Datalake / Reference)
- **Provenance**: HFO Gen 88 Active State
- **Role**: Reference view for archives and forensic analysis.
